Obtain and use the template to know how the pixels are supposed to be placed. Thank you.

Head attacker is Twitch streamer ElZeein.

Edit: 6: 25 UTC, July 22, ElZeein has begun attacking Bad Apple.

Edit: 6: 35 UTC, July 22, the first wave of attack is over. Bad Apple survived and is still ongoing. ElZeein is apparently planning on drawing something on top of the animation.

Edit: 6: 50 UTC, July 22, ElZeein threatened that if his cat (That destroyed Foxhole, Babymetal, and part of r/Save3rdPartyApps ) gets attacked once more, he will wipe out Bad Apple.

Edit: According to  [**u/cheetahound**](https://www.reddit.com/user/cheetahound/) in the comments, ElZeein calls it off because ""he just watched the animation and called it pretty"". However, according to another redditor, u/imtuc ,he promised to strike again. I myself do not know which one is true, since I wasn't there at the time.

Edit: As of 10:45 UTC, July 22, ElZeein's cat has completely disintegrated. Foxhole, Babymetal, and r/Save3rdPartyApps have been restored.

Once again, thanks to all communities that support this project.",-0.9451,-0.9451,-0.9451,-0.9451,https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/156c2xi/attention_elzeein_is_planning_on_destroying_the/,07/22/2023,11:17:59,Polemo03,139,Americas

Apple,"Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024","Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024 Apple has been relatively quiet on the generative AI front in recent months, which makes them a relative anomaly as Meta, Microsoft, and more all duke it out for the future of AI.

The relative silence doesn't mean Apple hasn't been doing anything, and [today's Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google) (note: paywalled) sheds light on their master plan: they're quietly but ambitiously laying the groundwork for some major moves in AI in 2024.

**Driving the news:**

* **Apple is internally testing a chatbot dubbed ""Apple GPT"" right now.** After being caught ""flat-footed"" by ChatGPT, they're playing catch up.
* **The company has also built a framework for creating LLMs, dubbed ""Ajax"".** Ajax is designed to accelerate Apple's ability to move quickly on the generative AI front heading into next year. Their overall plans are not public, but the leak about Ajax is a confirmation their ambition is wide in scope.

**Why this matters:** trillions of dollars in market cap are at stake.

* **While Apple has moved ahead with imbuing their products with AI** (maps, search, photos etc.), they're worried about losing the race in generative AI.
* **Their cautious approach towards AI and privacy means products like Siri have stagnated,** giving up their early mover advantage in the assistant space.
* **Apple regards generative AI as a ""paramount shift in how devices operate,""** and see this as an existential threat to the company's ability to sell devices.

**What is Tim Cook saying?**

* **In a recent interview, he acknowledged he's using ChatGPT.** It's something Apple is ""looking at closely,"" he confirmed
* **But overall Cook remains cautious:** Generative AI has a ""number of issues that need to be sorted,"" he said as recently as May.

**The main takeaway:** 

* Apple's recent previews of their Vision Pro show that they really want to get something right, in a way that can exceed existing consumer expectations. 
* If their release of generative AI tech to consumers doesn't turn out like Apple Maps did (a complete disaster of a launch), things could get very interesting in the LLM space. 
* BUT: Apple is under the gun here. The AI space is moving fast, and they don't have years of time to get things right.

**P.S. If you like this kind of analysis,** I write [a free newsletter](https://artisana.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=chatgpt) that tracks the biggest issues and implications of generative AI tech. It's sent once a week and helps you stay up-to-date in the time it takes to have your morning coffee.

Apple,"After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward.","After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward. MiHoYo hasn't been shy about using events as a sort of playground to experiment with upcoming mechanics. Very few weekly or monthly events aren't testing something MiHoYo either intends to implement in the near future for Genshin, or for another game they're developing. Such as photography battle event testing out Nahida's E skill, or the stall management minigame from the Weinlesefest festival ending up an entire major monthly content release in Honkai Star Rail. Even Sorush in the Sumeru desert seems to control suspiciously to how underwater gameplay might.

So, what did the 2.8 Apple Islands experiment with?

1. More traditional, major dungeons filled with traditional RPG mechanics, at many points open ended in exploration.

2. Exploring character backstories outside of character story quests.

3. More complex puzzles with solutions not immediately apparent. Typically unlocking these harder variants as optional content after beating the islands dungeon.

4. Huge set piece mechanisms in the overworld to interface with. Kazuha's island to reshape, mix-and-match. Xinyan's rising and falling mountains. Mona's past, present and future transportation circles, alongside the many starbits to find. Enough content on each island to need days worth of revisiting, if you wanted to do absolutely everything.

Notice the direction that the past year, including the summer event capping off the end of Sumeru, has taken.

Puzzles have all been exceedingly simple, varying between '*Put the round peg in the round hole*' to '*Interact with the glowy icon to proceed*' with a few notable exceptions that aren't found unless you return to the end of the pyramid dungeons after beating them. Desert dungeons have been largely on rails, stitched together with endless cutscenes of bickering NPCs telling you where to go and what to do.

MiHoYo tested a new vision for Genshin and, according to the posts I saw during 2.8, they got their answer.

1. Some people said the dungeons were difficult to navigate, that they had to look up guides. The mechanics in Fischl's dungeon were finicky. What happens in 3.8? No dungeons. The one big mechanic added was an on-rails rollercoaster.

2. Some people found Xinyan to be a really uninteresting character and didn't care for her backstory. Some people found Fischl annoying. Kazuha's backstory was even hit or miss for a vocal minority, as much of it as we've already seen explored. What happens in 3.8? Not a single characters backstory is ever touched upon. We don't even get Alice checking in on her daughter in 3.8. The characters in the event only react to one another in terms of their base personalities, with no greater understanding of who they are by the end of it.

3. Most every puzzle is '*Go to this place and interact with the thing, or pick up the round peg and put it in the round hole*'. The only real harder variant of any content is three increasingly difficult rollercoaster rides, which were fun but also too few.

4. What you see is what you get. Most every location is used once for a short period of time, no reason to revisit unless you're scooping up treasure chests marked on your map. A number of patches needed to be hotfixed in during 2.8 in response to mobile players difficulty in rendering certain graphics or interfacing with certain mechanics, keeping things simple means less risk of things breaking.

The hit-or-miss reception to 2.8 seems to have lead to a smaller scale, less time investment experience in 3.8.

**Conclusion**: 2.8 wasn't bad content, it was just doing too much in too little a time. It should have just been permanent content instead that stuck around after 2.8 ended, just like the Chasm quest with Itto, Yelan and the gang. 2.8 offered an abundance of content that many casual players were overwhelmed by, having a ticking timer telling them how long they had to explore it all. Every small flaw was magnified by those constraints.

MiHoYo seems disinclined to revisit that sort of content, which I think means they learned the wrong lesson from it. Optional harder puzzles and content are phased out for a steady dripfeed of primogems and characters only get explored in their individual quests, creating a far safer experience but also a far less memorable one.

I still hope they bring back the 2.8 islands as perma-content for those that missed it.",0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/14xmyac/after_completing_38_it_seems_the_28_golden_apple/,07/12/2023,17:16:51,HereForGames,624,Americas

Apple,r/Apple Blackout: What happened,"r/Apple Blackout: What happened Hey r/Apple.

It’s been an interesting week. Hot off the heels of WWDC and in the height of beta season, we [took the subreddit private in protest of Reddit’s API changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/142kca6/rapple_will_be_joining_the_blackout_to_protest/) that had large scaling effects. While we are sure most of you have heard the details, we are going to summarize a few of them:

- [Force most 3rd party apps like Apollo to shut down due to ridiculous pricing schemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/)
- [Hinder moderation tools that are vital to subreddit management](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) 
- [Create an accessibility nightmare for blind users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/) 

While we absolutely agree that Reddit has every right to charge for API access, we don’t agree with the absurd amount they are charging (for Apollo it would be 20 million a year). I’m sure some of you will say it’s ironic that a subreddit about Apple _cough_ app store _cough_ is commenting on a company charging its developers a large amount of money. 

[Reddit’s asshole CEO u/spez made it clear that Reddit was not backing down on their changes](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762501/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-interview-protests-blackout) but assured users that apps or tools meant for accessibility will be unharmed along with most moderation tools and bots. While this was great to hear, it still wasn't enough. [So along with hundreds of other subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) including our friends over at r/iPhone, r/iOS, r/AppleWatch, and r/Jailbreak, we decided to stay private indefinitely until Reddit changed course by giving third-party apps a fair price for API access. 

Now you must be wondering, “I’m seeing this post, does that mean they budged?” Unfortunately, the answer is no. You are seeing this post because [Reddit has threatened to open subreddits regardless of mod action and replace entire teams that otherwise refuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/14a5lz5/mod_code_of_conduct_rule_4_2_and_subs_taken/jo9wdol/). We want the best for this community and have no choice but to open it back up — or have it opened for us.

So to summarize: **fuck u/spez, we hope you resign.**

Apple,r/Apple will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit killing 3rd Party Apps such as Apollo,"r/Apple will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit killing 3rd Party Apps such as Apollo #What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface [](/ajwtf ""and everything that goes with it!"").

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

#What's the plan? 

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord  - but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.

3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.

Apple,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,Americas

The free and add supported stuff is never what it should be, for casual users. It’s bait.

Apple needs to get this under control. They won’t, hooking whales is how they make money, but this is our family’s last iPad until things change. 

At bare minimum, Apple needs to put subscriptions, along with the average paid subscription price, at the listing level of the app next to the “GET” button, not buried under “has IAP” and then we have to click j to the store listing and scroll down to the IAP triangle and open that up too. For every single app. That UI pattern is not something that is reasonable.

I’m sure the mods and community will block this, it’s knocking Apple, but the state of the App Store is untenable as a lifelong Apple fan. Tim Cook and crew have the power to show customers they care about making good products, not good profits. They won’t, but boy would it would be nice to feel good about opening my iPad and not like a constant struggle to keep the cost under a reasonable amount per month.",0.973,0.973,0.973,0.973,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/151mfmk/every_app_on_the_ipad_is_subscription_based_to_do/,07/17/2023,05:24:02,MadeByTango,283,Americas

Apple,I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn.,"I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn. So uh, was traveling from Patna to blr on 1st July. I remember the apple pencil being attached to my iPad when I was packing. (Pencil on ipad, and ipad in a thick case)

Then I removed the ipad in the flight to watch a movie and it was missing. I noticed that the zip of the case was open a lil bit

Only two places where the case containing the ipad was removed: 

1) when we were frantically searching for my student ID card just after entering the airport because we thought we had applied student ticket but had not remembered to keep the I'd card w us. So we removed all the contents of our 3 carrybags. Inside my brother's bag was our iPad case which he also removed along with other contents. Maybe it slipped that time?

2) keeping all our electronic devices on the tray so that it can pass through security check scan. That time we removed the entire case along with 3-4 earbuds, another iPad, phones, wallets etc. But i remember placing the tray back in the tray stash and idr seeing my pencil left in it...

These are the only 2 places where it was removed between it being packed in the bag and removed in the flight.

The case of the ipad is thick and cushioned inside for protection. It's unlikely that somehow the pen unattached itself from the strong magnetic hold of the ipad and then slipped out of the case's zip...

My dad thinks MAYBE it fell in the flight WHILE I was removing it from the case. So I called up indigo lost and found and did file a missing item, but idk what will happen :(

I needed that pencil as my college is gonna start soon. Yeah I can buy a knockoff on Amazon but I feel so bad for misplacing it. It's like a mystery, we're just not able to figure out where it might have slipped.

Thanks for listening lol

Apple,"Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong?","Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong? I’m in my early 20’s in college and devout about 70% of my paycheck into 5 stocks, like the title says: TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, and APPL.

Why does this feel like a both good and bad long term strategy of investing? On one side, I can’t see these stocks going anywhere, tech only will expand, and even if tech stocks crash, these stocks seem to be able to extend beyond just “tech”, ie TSLA with cars, AMZN with grocery stores, APPL with, well, phones and computers, Microsoft seemingly expanding to being a company that branches far past tech, and even Google even though operation as a search engine seems to have and will continue to cement themselves as a leading corporation in America.

Of course, I’m not saying anything special. I’m just wondering, is this a foolish plan? I know diversification is important, but it seems just dumping as much as I can in these stocks for the next 20 years is a solid investment strategy that should enable me to become financially free and eligible for retirement by 40.

It’s honestly nice not having to research new companies and hope my research pans out. Just dumping my money in these already established companies and believing that they’re going to be even bigger and more importantly still around and operating in profit in 20 years makes my investment strategy feel easy and relaxing. Yet, is it supposed to feel this easy?

Apple,Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra,"Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra I have loved my Ultra, it's a fantastic watch. I've been wearing it from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep, and sometimes while I sleep since last September, so for nearly a year now. 

The reason I stopped wearing it is because my left wrist has a noticeable ""divot"", or shallow depression where the sensor bulge sits on my wrist. It's hard to see in photos but easy to notice simply by pinching both wrists. Yes I know it's not my dominant arm but it's too noticeable to ignore. Honestly it freaked me out when I first noticed it.

The main issue with the Ultra is that it's a beast. For me I think it's just too big. I truly wish Apple would make an ""Apple Watch Slim"" with all the same functionality except the fitness features and without the sensor bulge. Imagine the battery life improvement you'd get without the sensors and lights running constantly. And SUCH a better form factor. 

Curious if anyone else who's worn their Ultra for as long as I have has noticed this on their wrist. After just a few days of wearing my crappy timex my left wrist is already starting to lose the divot.",0.9455,0.9455,0.9455,0.9455,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/155r8q4/stopped_wearing_my_apple_watch_ultra/,07/21/2023,20:29:10,inorganik,296,Americas

Edit: 6: 35 UTC, July 22, the first wave of attack is over. Bad Apple survived and is still ongoing. ElZeein is apparently planning on drawing something on top of the animation.

Edit: 6: 50 UTC, July 22, ElZeein threatened that if his cat (That destroyed Foxhole, Babymetal, and part of r/Save3rdPartyApps ) gets attacked once more, he will wipe out Bad Apple.

Edit: According to  [**u/cheetahound**](https://www.reddit.com/user/cheetahound/) in the comments, ElZeein calls it off because ""he just watched the animation and called it pretty"". However, according to another redditor, u/imtuc ,he promised to strike again. I myself do not know which one is true, since I wasn't there at the time.

Edit: As of 10:45 UTC, July 22, ElZeein's cat has completely disintegrated. Foxhole, Babymetal, and r/Save3rdPartyApps have been restored.

Apple,"Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024","Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024 Apple has been relatively quiet on the generative AI front in recent months, which makes them a relative anomaly as Meta, Microsoft, and more all duke it out for the future of AI.

The relative silence doesn't mean Apple hasn't been doing anything, and [today's Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google) (note: paywalled) sheds light on their master plan: they're quietly but ambitiously laying the groundwork for some major moves in AI in 2024.

**Driving the news:**

* **Apple is internally testing a chatbot dubbed ""Apple GPT"" right now.** After being caught ""flat-footed"" by ChatGPT, they're playing catch up.
* **The company has also built a framework for creating LLMs, dubbed ""Ajax"".** Ajax is designed to accelerate Apple's ability to move quickly on the generative AI front heading into next year. Their overall plans are not public, but the leak about Ajax is a confirmation their ambition is wide in scope.

**Why this matters:** trillions of dollars in market cap are at stake.

* **While Apple has moved ahead with imbuing their products with AI** (maps, search, photos etc.), they're worried about losing the race in generative AI.
* **Their cautious approach towards AI and privacy means products like Siri have stagnated,** giving up their early mover advantage in the assistant space.
* **Apple regards generative AI as a ""paramount shift in how devices operate,""** and see this as an existential threat to the company's ability to sell devices.

**What is Tim Cook saying?**

* **In a recent interview, he acknowledged he's using ChatGPT.** It's something Apple is ""looking at closely,"" he confirmed
* **But overall Cook remains cautious:** Generative AI has a ""number of issues that need to be sorted,"" he said as recently as May.

**The main takeaway:** 

* Apple's recent previews of their Vision Pro show that they really want to get something right, in a way that can exceed existing consumer expectations. 
* If their release of generative AI tech to consumers doesn't turn out like Apple Maps did (a complete disaster of a launch), things could get very interesting in the LLM space. 
* BUT: Apple is under the gun here. The AI space is moving fast, and they don't have years of time to get things right.

**P.S. If you like this kind of analysis,** I write [a free newsletter](https://artisana.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=chatgpt) that tracks the biggest issues and implications of generative AI tech. It's sent once a week and helps you stay up-to-date in the time it takes to have your morning coffee.

Apple,"After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward.","After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward. MiHoYo hasn't been shy about using events as a sort of playground to experiment with upcoming mechanics. Very few weekly or monthly events aren't testing something MiHoYo either intends to implement in the near future for Genshin, or for another game they're developing. Such as photography battle event testing out Nahida's E skill, or the stall management minigame from the Weinlesefest festival ending up an entire major monthly content release in Honkai Star Rail. Even Sorush in the Sumeru desert seems to control suspiciously to how underwater gameplay might.

So, what did the 2.8 Apple Islands experiment with?

1. More traditional, major dungeons filled with traditional RPG mechanics, at many points open ended in exploration.

2. Exploring character backstories outside of character story quests.

3. More complex puzzles with solutions not immediately apparent. Typically unlocking these harder variants as optional content after beating the islands dungeon.

4. Huge set piece mechanisms in the overworld to interface with. Kazuha's island to reshape, mix-and-match. Xinyan's rising and falling mountains. Mona's past, present and future transportation circles, alongside the many starbits to find. Enough content on each island to need days worth of revisiting, if you wanted to do absolutely everything.

Notice the direction that the past year, including the summer event capping off the end of Sumeru, has taken.

Puzzles have all been exceedingly simple, varying between '*Put the round peg in the round hole*' to '*Interact with the glowy icon to proceed*' with a few notable exceptions that aren't found unless you return to the end of the pyramid dungeons after beating them. Desert dungeons have been largely on rails, stitched together with endless cutscenes of bickering NPCs telling you where to go and what to do.

MiHoYo tested a new vision for Genshin and, according to the posts I saw during 2.8, they got their answer.

1. Some people said the dungeons were difficult to navigate, that they had to look up guides. The mechanics in Fischl's dungeon were finicky. What happens in 3.8? No dungeons. The one big mechanic added was an on-rails rollercoaster.

2. Some people found Xinyan to be a really uninteresting character and didn't care for her backstory. Some people found Fischl annoying. Kazuha's backstory was even hit or miss for a vocal minority, as much of it as we've already seen explored. What happens in 3.8? Not a single characters backstory is ever touched upon. We don't even get Alice checking in on her daughter in 3.8. The characters in the event only react to one another in terms of their base personalities, with no greater understanding of who they are by the end of it.

3. Most every puzzle is '*Go to this place and interact with the thing, or pick up the round peg and put it in the round hole*'. The only real harder variant of any content is three increasingly difficult rollercoaster rides, which were fun but also too few.

4. What you see is what you get. Most every location is used once for a short period of time, no reason to revisit unless you're scooping up treasure chests marked on your map. A number of patches needed to be hotfixed in during 2.8 in response to mobile players difficulty in rendering certain graphics or interfacing with certain mechanics, keeping things simple means less risk of things breaking.

The hit-or-miss reception to 2.8 seems to have lead to a smaller scale, less time investment experience in 3.8.

**Conclusion**: 2.8 wasn't bad content, it was just doing too much in too little a time. It should have just been permanent content instead that stuck around after 2.8 ended, just like the Chasm quest with Itto, Yelan and the gang. 2.8 offered an abundance of content that many casual players were overwhelmed by, having a ticking timer telling them how long they had to explore it all. Every small flaw was magnified by those constraints.

MiHoYo seems disinclined to revisit that sort of content, which I think means they learned the wrong lesson from it. Optional harder puzzles and content are phased out for a steady dripfeed of primogems and characters only get explored in their individual quests, creating a far safer experience but also a far less memorable one.

I still hope they bring back the 2.8 islands as perma-content for those that missed it.",0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/14xmyac/after_completing_38_it_seems_the_28_golden_apple/,07/12/2023,17:16:51,HereForGames,624,Europe

Apple,r/Apple Blackout: What happened,"r/Apple Blackout: What happened Hey r/Apple.

It’s been an interesting week. Hot off the heels of WWDC and in the height of beta season, we [took the subreddit private in protest of Reddit’s API changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/142kca6/rapple_will_be_joining_the_blackout_to_protest/) that had large scaling effects. While we are sure most of you have heard the details, we are going to summarize a few of them:

- [Force most 3rd party apps like Apollo to shut down due to ridiculous pricing schemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/)
- [Hinder moderation tools that are vital to subreddit management](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) 
- [Create an accessibility nightmare for blind users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/) 

While we absolutely agree that Reddit has every right to charge for API access, we don’t agree with the absurd amount they are charging (for Apollo it would be 20 million a year). I’m sure some of you will say it’s ironic that a subreddit about Apple _cough_ app store _cough_ is commenting on a company charging its developers a large amount of money. 

[Reddit’s asshole CEO u/spez made it clear that Reddit was not backing down on their changes](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762501/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-interview-protests-blackout) but assured users that apps or tools meant for accessibility will be unharmed along with most moderation tools and bots. While this was great to hear, it still wasn't enough. [So along with hundreds of other subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) including our friends over at r/iPhone, r/iOS, r/AppleWatch, and r/Jailbreak, we decided to stay private indefinitely until Reddit changed course by giving third-party apps a fair price for API access. 

Now you must be wondering, “I’m seeing this post, does that mean they budged?” Unfortunately, the answer is no. You are seeing this post because [Reddit has threatened to open subreddits regardless of mod action and replace entire teams that otherwise refuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/14a5lz5/mod_code_of_conduct_rule_4_2_and_subs_taken/jo9wdol/). We want the best for this community and have no choice but to open it back up — or have it opened for us.

So to summarize: **fuck u/spez, we hope you resign.**

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface [](/ajwtf ""and everything that goes with it!"").

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

#What's the plan? 

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord  - but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.

3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.

Apple,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,Europe

Apple,Every app on the iPad is subscription based; to do what Apple advertised and use the apps they promote I’m looking at $200+ in recurring monthly app subscriptions…what?,"Every app on the iPad is subscription based; to do what Apple advertised and use the apps they promote I’m looking at $200+ in recurring monthly app subscriptions…what? Between everything trying to dump stuff onto iCloud and every productivity app thinking they’re worth $10 every month, the App Store is fundamentally broken. I don’t have $2400/yr budgeted for home software. Recurring. I’ve $20 and $30 at a time needs. Apps are not my life style, they’re solving a need, usually only one per app. I have iCloud storage, I don’t need to put my notes on your servers and pay you to hold them hostage if I don’t resubscribe after you raise prices, thanks. The free and add supported stuff is never what it should be, for casual users. It’s bait.

Apple needs to get this under control. They won’t, hooking whales is how they make money, but this is our family’s last iPad until things change. 

At bare minimum, Apple needs to put subscriptions, along with the average paid subscription price, at the listing level of the app next to the “GET” button, not buried under “has IAP” and then we have to click j to the store listing and scroll down to the IAP triangle and open that up too. For every single app. That UI pattern is not something that is reasonable.

I’m sure the mods and community will block this, it’s knocking Apple, but the state of the App Store is untenable as a lifelong Apple fan. Tim Cook and crew have the power to show customers they care about making good products, not good profits. They won’t, but boy would it would be nice to feel good about opening my iPad and not like a constant struggle to keep the cost under a reasonable amount per month.",0.973,0.973,0.973,0.973,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/151mfmk/every_app_on_the_ipad_is_subscription_based_to_do/,07/17/2023,05:24:02,MadeByTango,283,Europe

Apple,I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn.,"I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn. So uh, was traveling from Patna to blr on 1st July. I remember the apple pencil being attached to my iPad when I was packing. (Pencil on ipad, and ipad in a thick case)

Then I removed the ipad in the flight to watch a movie and it was missing. I noticed that the zip of the case was open a lil bit

Only two places where the case containing the ipad was removed: 

1) when we were frantically searching for my student ID card just after entering the airport because we thought we had applied student ticket but had not remembered to keep the I'd card w us. So we removed all the contents of our 3 carrybags. Inside my brother's bag was our iPad case which he also removed along with other contents. Maybe it slipped that time?

2) keeping all our electronic devices on the tray so that it can pass through security check scan. That time we removed the entire case along with 3-4 earbuds, another iPad, phones, wallets etc. But i remember placing the tray back in the tray stash and idr seeing my pencil left in it...

These are the only 2 places where it was removed between it being packed in the bag and removed in the flight.

The case of the ipad is thick and cushioned inside for protection. It's unlikely that somehow the pen unattached itself from the strong magnetic hold of the ipad and then slipped out of the case's zip...

My dad thinks MAYBE it fell in the flight WHILE I was removing it from the case. So I called up indigo lost and found and did file a missing item, but idk what will happen :(

I needed that pencil as my college is gonna start soon. Yeah I can buy a knockoff on Amazon but I feel so bad for misplacing it. It's like a mystery, we're just not able to figure out where it might have slipped.

Thanks for listening lol

Apple,"Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong?","Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong? I’m in my early 20’s in college and devout about 70% of my paycheck into 5 stocks, like the title says: TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, and APPL.

Why does this feel like a both good and bad long term strategy of investing? On one side, I can’t see these stocks going anywhere, tech only will expand, and even if tech stocks crash, these stocks seem to be able to extend beyond just “tech”, ie TSLA with cars, AMZN with grocery stores, APPL with, well, phones and computers, Microsoft seemingly expanding to being a company that branches far past tech, and even Google even though operation as a search engine seems to have and will continue to cement themselves as a leading corporation in America.

Of course, I’m not saying anything special. I’m just wondering, is this a foolish plan? I know diversification is important, but it seems just dumping as much as I can in these stocks for the next 20 years is a solid investment strategy that should enable me to become financially free and eligible for retirement by 40.

It’s honestly nice not having to research new companies and hope my research pans out. Just dumping my money in these already established companies and believing that they’re going to be even bigger and more importantly still around and operating in profit in 20 years makes my investment strategy feel easy and relaxing. Yet, is it supposed to feel this easy?

Apple,Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra,"Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra I have loved my Ultra, it's a fantastic watch. I've been wearing it from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep, and sometimes while I sleep since last September, so for nearly a year now. 

The reason I stopped wearing it is because my left wrist has a noticeable ""divot"", or shallow depression where the sensor bulge sits on my wrist. It's hard to see in photos but easy to notice simply by pinching both wrists. Yes I know it's not my dominant arm but it's too noticeable to ignore. Honestly it freaked me out when I first noticed it.

The main issue with the Ultra is that it's a beast. For me I think it's just too big. I truly wish Apple would make an ""Apple Watch Slim"" with all the same functionality except the fitness features and without the sensor bulge. Imagine the battery life improvement you'd get without the sensors and lights running constantly. And SUCH a better form factor. 

Curious if anyone else who's worn their Ultra for as long as I have has noticed this on their wrist.

Head attacker is Twitch streamer ElZeein.

Edit: 6: 25 UTC, July 22, ElZeein has begun attacking Bad Apple.

Edit: 6: 35 UTC, July 22, the first wave of attack is over. Bad Apple survived and is still ongoing. ElZeein is apparently planning on drawing something on top of the animation.

Edit: 6: 50 UTC, July 22, ElZeein threatened that if his cat (That destroyed Foxhole, Babymetal, and part of r/Save3rdPartyApps ) gets attacked once more, he will wipe out Bad Apple.

Edit: According to  [**u/cheetahound**](https://www.reddit.com/user/cheetahound/) in the comments, ElZeein calls it off because ""he just watched the animation and called it pretty"". However, according to another redditor, u/imtuc ,he promised to strike again. I myself do not know which one is true, since I wasn't there at the time.

Edit: As of 10:45 UTC, July 22, ElZeein's cat has completely disintegrated. Foxhole, Babymetal, and r/Save3rdPartyApps have been restored.

Once again, thanks to all communities that support this project.",-0.9451,-0.9451,-0.9451,-0.9451,https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/156c2xi/attention_elzeein_is_planning_on_destroying_the/,07/22/2023,11:17:59,Polemo03,139,Africa

Apple,"Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024","Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024 Apple has been relatively quiet on the generative AI front in recent months, which makes them a relative anomaly as Meta, Microsoft, and more all duke it out for the future of AI.

The relative silence doesn't mean Apple hasn't been doing anything, and [today's Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google) (note: paywalled) sheds light on their master plan: they're quietly but ambitiously laying the groundwork for some major moves in AI in 2024.

**Driving the news:**

* **Apple is internally testing a chatbot dubbed ""Apple GPT"" right now.** After being caught ""flat-footed"" by ChatGPT, they're playing catch up.
* **The company has also built a framework for creating LLMs, dubbed ""Ajax"".** Ajax is designed to accelerate Apple's ability to move quickly on the generative AI front heading into next year. Their overall plans are not public, but the leak about Ajax is a confirmation their ambition is wide in scope.

**Why this matters:** trillions of dollars in market cap are at stake.

* **While Apple has moved ahead with imbuing their products with AI** (maps, search, photos etc.), they're worried about losing the race in generative AI.
* **Their cautious approach towards AI and privacy means products like Siri have stagnated,** giving up their early mover advantage in the assistant space.
* **Apple regards generative AI as a ""paramount shift in how devices operate,""** and see this as an existential threat to the company's ability to sell devices.

**What is Tim Cook saying?**

* **In a recent interview, he acknowledged he's using ChatGPT.** It's something Apple is ""looking at closely,"" he confirmed
* **But overall Cook remains cautious:** Generative AI has a ""number of issues that need to be sorted,"" he said as recently as May.

**The main takeaway:** 

* Apple's recent previews of their Vision Pro show that they really want to get something right, in a way that can exceed existing consumer expectations. 
* If their release of generative AI tech to consumers doesn't turn out like Apple Maps did (a complete disaster of a launch), things could get very interesting in the LLM space. 
* BUT: Apple is under the gun here. The AI space is moving fast, and they don't have years of time to get things right.

**P.S. If you like this kind of analysis,** I write [a free newsletter](https://artisana.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=chatgpt) that tracks the biggest issues and implications of generative AI tech. It's sent once a week and helps you stay up-to-date in the time it takes to have your morning coffee.

Apple,"After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward.","After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward. MiHoYo hasn't been shy about using events as a sort of playground to experiment with upcoming mechanics. Very few weekly or monthly events aren't testing something MiHoYo either intends to implement in the near future for Genshin, or for another game they're developing. Such as photography battle event testing out Nahida's E skill, or the stall management minigame from the Weinlesefest festival ending up an entire major monthly content release in Honkai Star Rail. Even Sorush in the Sumeru desert seems to control suspiciously to how underwater gameplay might.

So, what did the 2.8 Apple Islands experiment with?

1. More traditional, major dungeons filled with traditional RPG mechanics, at many points open ended in exploration.

2. Exploring character backstories outside of character story quests.

3. More complex puzzles with solutions not immediately apparent. Typically unlocking these harder variants as optional content after beating the islands dungeon.

4. Huge set piece mechanisms in the overworld to interface with. Kazuha's island to reshape, mix-and-match. Xinyan's rising and falling mountains. Mona's past, present and future transportation circles, alongside the many starbits to find. Enough content on each island to need days worth of revisiting, if you wanted to do absolutely everything.

Notice the direction that the past year, including the summer event capping off the end of Sumeru, has taken.

Puzzles have all been exceedingly simple, varying between '*Put the round peg in the round hole*' to '*Interact with the glowy icon to proceed*' with a few notable exceptions that aren't found unless you return to the end of the pyramid dungeons after beating them. Desert dungeons have been largely on rails, stitched together with endless cutscenes of bickering NPCs telling you where to go and what to do.

MiHoYo tested a new vision for Genshin and, according to the posts I saw during 2.8, they got their answer.

1. Some people said the dungeons were difficult to navigate, that they had to look up guides. The mechanics in Fischl's dungeon were finicky. What happens in 3.8? No dungeons. The one big mechanic added was an on-rails rollercoaster.

2. Some people found Xinyan to be a really uninteresting character and didn't care for her backstory. Some people found Fischl annoying. Kazuha's backstory was even hit or miss for a vocal minority, as much of it as we've already seen explored. What happens in 3.8? Not a single characters backstory is ever touched upon. We don't even get Alice checking in on her daughter in 3.8. The characters in the event only react to one another in terms of their base personalities, with no greater understanding of who they are by the end of it.

3. Most every puzzle is '*Go to this place and interact with the thing, or pick up the round peg and put it in the round hole*'. The only real harder variant of any content is three increasingly difficult rollercoaster rides, which were fun but also too few.

4. What you see is what you get. Most every location is used once for a short period of time, no reason to revisit unless you're scooping up treasure chests marked on your map. A number of patches needed to be hotfixed in during 2.8 in response to mobile players difficulty in rendering certain graphics or interfacing with certain mechanics, keeping things simple means less risk of things breaking.

The hit-or-miss reception to 2.8 seems to have lead to a smaller scale, less time investment experience in 3.8.

**Conclusion**: 2.8 wasn't bad content, it was just doing too much in too little a time. It should have just been permanent content instead that stuck around after 2.8 ended, just like the Chasm quest with Itto, Yelan and the gang. 2.8 offered an abundance of content that many casual players were overwhelmed by, having a ticking timer telling them how long they had to explore it all. Every small flaw was magnified by those constraints.

MiHoYo seems disinclined to revisit that sort of content, which I think means they learned the wrong lesson from it. Optional harder puzzles and content are phased out for a steady dripfeed of primogems and characters only get explored in their individual quests, creating a far safer experience but also a far less memorable one.

I still hope they bring back the 2.8 islands as perma-content for those that missed it.",0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/14xmyac/after_completing_38_it_seems_the_28_golden_apple/,07/12/2023,17:16:51,HereForGames,624,Africa

Apple,r/Apple Blackout: What happened,"r/Apple Blackout: What happened Hey r/Apple.

It’s been an interesting week. Hot off the heels of WWDC and in the height of beta season, we [took the subreddit private in protest of Reddit’s API changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/142kca6/rapple_will_be_joining_the_blackout_to_protest/) that had large scaling effects. While we are sure most of you have heard the details, we are going to summarize a few of them:

- [Force most 3rd party apps like Apollo to shut down due to ridiculous pricing schemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/)
- [Hinder moderation tools that are vital to subreddit management](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) 
- [Create an accessibility nightmare for blind users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/) 

While we absolutely agree that Reddit has every right to charge for API access, we don’t agree with the absurd amount they are charging (for Apollo it would be 20 million a year). I’m sure some of you will say it’s ironic that a subreddit about Apple _cough_ app store _cough_ is commenting on a company charging its developers a large amount of money. 

[Reddit’s asshole CEO u/spez made it clear that Reddit was not backing down on their changes](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762501/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-interview-protests-blackout) but assured users that apps or tools meant for accessibility will be unharmed along with most moderation tools and bots. While this was great to hear, it still wasn't enough. [So along with hundreds of other subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) including our friends over at r/iPhone, r/iOS, r/AppleWatch, and r/Jailbreak, we decided to stay private indefinitely until Reddit changed course by giving third-party apps a fair price for API access. 

Now you must be wondering, “I’m seeing this post, does that mean they budged?” Unfortunately, the answer is no. You are seeing this post because [Reddit has threatened to open subreddits regardless of mod action and replace entire teams that otherwise refuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/14a5lz5/mod_code_of_conduct_rule_4_2_and_subs_taken/jo9wdol/). We want the best for this community and have no choice but to open it back up — or have it opened for us.

So to summarize: **fuck u/spez, we hope you resign.**

Apple,r/Apple will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit killing 3rd Party Apps such as Apollo,"r/Apple will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit killing 3rd Party Apps such as Apollo #What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface [](/ajwtf ""and everything that goes with it!"").

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

#What's the plan? 

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord  - but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.

3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.

Apple,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,Africa

Between everything trying to dump stuff onto iCloud and every productivity app thinking they’re worth $10 every month, the App Store is fundamentally broken. I don’t have $2400/yr budgeted for home software. Recurring. I’ve $20 and $30 at a time needs. Apps are not my life style, they’re solving a need, usually only one per app. I have iCloud storage, I don’t need to put my notes on your servers and pay you to hold them hostage if I don’t resubscribe after you raise prices, thanks. The free and add supported stuff is never what it should be, for casual users. It’s bait.

Apple needs to get this under control. They won’t, hooking whales is how they make money, but this is our family’s last iPad until things change. 

At bare minimum, Apple needs to put subscriptions, along with the average paid subscription price, at the listing level of the app next to the “GET” button, not buried under “has IAP” and then we have to click j to the store listing and scroll down to the IAP triangle and open that up too. For every single app. That UI pattern is not something that is reasonable.

I’m sure the mods and community will block this, it’s knocking Apple, but the state of the App Store is untenable as a lifelong Apple fan. Tim Cook and crew have the power to show customers they care about making good products, not good profits. They won’t, but boy would it would be nice to feel good about opening my iPad and not like a constant struggle to keep the cost under a reasonable amount per month.",0.973,0.973,0.973,0.973,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/151mfmk/every_app_on_the_ipad_is_subscription_based_to_do/,07/17/2023,05:24:02,MadeByTango,283,Africa

Apple,I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn.,"I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn. So uh, was traveling from Patna to blr on 1st July. I remember the apple pencil being attached to my iPad when I was packing. (Pencil on ipad, and ipad in a thick case)

Then I removed the ipad in the flight to watch a movie and it was missing. I noticed that the zip of the case was open a lil bit

Only two places where the case containing the ipad was removed: 

1) when we were frantically searching for my student ID card just after entering the airport because we thought we had applied student ticket but had not remembered to keep the I'd card w us. So we removed all the contents of our 3 carrybags. Inside my brother's bag was our iPad case which he also removed along with other contents. Maybe it slipped that time?

2) keeping all our electronic devices on the tray so that it can pass through security check scan. That time we removed the entire case along with 3-4 earbuds, another iPad, phones, wallets etc. But i remember placing the tray back in the tray stash and idr seeing my pencil left in it...

These are the only 2 places where it was removed between it being packed in the bag and removed in the flight.

The case of the ipad is thick and cushioned inside for protection. It's unlikely that somehow the pen unattached itself from the strong magnetic hold of the ipad and then slipped out of the case's zip...

My dad thinks MAYBE it fell in the flight WHILE I was removing it from the case. So I called up indigo lost and found and did file a missing item, but idk what will happen :(

I needed that pencil as my college is gonna start soon. Yeah I can buy a knockoff on Amazon but I feel so bad for misplacing it. It's like a mystery, we're just not able to figure out where it might have slipped.

Thanks for listening lol

Apple,"Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong?","Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong? I’m in my early 20’s in college and devout about 70% of my paycheck into 5 stocks, like the title says: TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, and APPL.

Why does this feel like a both good and bad long term strategy of investing? On one side, I can’t see these stocks going anywhere, tech only will expand, and even if tech stocks crash, these stocks seem to be able to extend beyond just “tech”, ie TSLA with cars, AMZN with grocery stores, APPL with, well, phones and computers, Microsoft seemingly expanding to being a company that branches far past tech, and even Google even though operation as a search engine seems to have and will continue to cement themselves as a leading corporation in America.

Of course, I’m not saying anything special. I’m just wondering, is this a foolish plan? I know diversification is important, but it seems just dumping as much as I can in these stocks for the next 20 years is a solid investment strategy that should enable me to become financially free and eligible for retirement by 40.

It’s honestly nice not having to research new companies and hope my research pans out. Just dumping my money in these already established companies and believing that they’re going to be even bigger and more importantly still around and operating in profit in 20 years makes my investment strategy feel easy and relaxing. Yet, is it supposed to feel this easy?

Apple,Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra,"Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra I have loved my Ultra, it's a fantastic watch. I've been wearing it from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep, and sometimes while I sleep since last September, so for nearly a year now. 

The reason I stopped wearing it is because my left wrist has a noticeable ""divot"", or shallow depression where the sensor bulge sits on my wrist. It's hard to see in photos but easy to notice simply by pinching both wrists. Yes I know it's not my dominant arm but it's too noticeable to ignore. Honestly it freaked me out when I first noticed it.

The main issue with the Ultra is that it's a beast. For me I think it's just too big. I truly wish Apple would make an ""Apple Watch Slim"" with all the same functionality except the fitness features and without the sensor bulge. Imagine the battery life improvement you'd get without the sensors and lights running constantly. And SUCH a better form factor. 

Curious if anyone else who's worn their Ultra for as long as I have has noticed this on their wrist. After just a few days of wearing my crappy timex my left wrist is already starting to lose the divot.",0.9455,0.9455,0.9455,0.9455,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/155r8q4/stopped_wearing_my_apple_watch_ultra/,07/21/2023,20:29:10,inorganik,296,Africa

Head attacker is Twitch streamer ElZeein.

Edit: 6: 25 UTC, July 22, ElZeein has begun attacking Bad Apple.

Edit: 6: 35 UTC, July 22, the first wave of attack is over. Bad Apple survived and is still ongoing. ElZeein is apparently planning on drawing something on top of the animation.

Edit: 6: 50 UTC, July 22, ElZeein threatened that if his cat (That destroyed Foxhole, Babymetal, and part of r/Save3rdPartyApps ) gets attacked once more, he will wipe out Bad Apple.

Edit: According to  [**u/cheetahound**](https://www.reddit.com/user/cheetahound/) in the comments, ElZeein calls it off because ""he just watched the animation and called it pretty"". However, according to another redditor, u/imtuc ,he promised to strike again. I myself do not know which one is true, since I wasn't there at the time.

Edit: As of 10:45 UTC, July 22, ElZeein's cat has completely disintegrated. Foxhole, Babymetal, and r/Save3rdPartyApps have been restored.

Apple,"Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024","Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024 Apple has been relatively quiet on the generative AI front in recent months, which makes them a relative anomaly as Meta, Microsoft, and more all duke it out for the future of AI.

The relative silence doesn't mean Apple hasn't been doing anything, and [today's Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google) (note: paywalled) sheds light on their master plan: they're quietly but ambitiously laying the groundwork for some major moves in AI in 2024.

**Driving the news:**

* **Apple is internally testing a chatbot dubbed ""Apple GPT"" right now.** After being caught ""flat-footed"" by ChatGPT, they're playing catch up.
* **The company has also built a framework for creating LLMs, dubbed ""Ajax"".** Ajax is designed to accelerate Apple's ability to move quickly on the generative AI front heading into next year. Their overall plans are not public, but the leak about Ajax is a confirmation their ambition is wide in scope.

**Why this matters:** trillions of dollars in market cap are at stake.

* **While Apple has moved ahead with imbuing their products with AI** (maps, search, photos etc.), they're worried about losing the race in generative AI.
* **Their cautious approach towards AI and privacy means products like Siri have stagnated,** giving up their early mover advantage in the assistant space.
* **Apple regards generative AI as a ""paramount shift in how devices operate,""** and see this as an existential threat to the company's ability to sell devices.

**What is Tim Cook saying?**

* **In a recent interview, he acknowledged he's using ChatGPT.** It's something Apple is ""looking at closely,"" he confirmed
* **But overall Cook remains cautious:** Generative AI has a ""number of issues that need to be sorted,"" he said as recently as May.

**The main takeaway:** 

* Apple's recent previews of their Vision Pro show that they really want to get something right, in a way that can exceed existing consumer expectations. 
* If their release of generative AI tech to consumers doesn't turn out like Apple Maps did (a complete disaster of a launch), things could get very interesting in the LLM space. 
* BUT: Apple is under the gun here. The AI space is moving fast, and they don't have years of time to get things right.

**P.S. If you like this kind of analysis,** I write [a free newsletter](https://artisana.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=chatgpt) that tracks the biggest issues and implications of generative AI tech. It's sent once a week and helps you stay up-to-date in the time it takes to have your morning coffee.

Apple,"After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward.","After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward. MiHoYo hasn't been shy about using events as a sort of playground to experiment with upcoming mechanics. Very few weekly or monthly events aren't testing something MiHoYo either intends to implement in the near future for Genshin, or for another game they're developing. Such as photography battle event testing out Nahida's E skill, or the stall management minigame from the Weinlesefest festival ending up an entire major monthly content release in Honkai Star Rail. Even Sorush in the Sumeru desert seems to control suspiciously to how underwater gameplay might.

So, what did the 2.8 Apple Islands experiment with?

1. More traditional, major dungeons filled with traditional RPG mechanics, at many points open ended in exploration.

2. Exploring character backstories outside of character story quests.

3. More complex puzzles with solutions not immediately apparent. Typically unlocking these harder variants as optional content after beating the islands dungeon.

4. Huge set piece mechanisms in the overworld to interface with. Kazuha's island to reshape, mix-and-match. Xinyan's rising and falling mountains. Mona's past, present and future transportation circles, alongside the many starbits to find. Enough content on each island to need days worth of revisiting, if you wanted to do absolutely everything.

Notice the direction that the past year, including the summer event capping off the end of Sumeru, has taken.

Puzzles have all been exceedingly simple, varying between '*Put the round peg in the round hole*' to '*Interact with the glowy icon to proceed*' with a few notable exceptions that aren't found unless you return to the end of the pyramid dungeons after beating them. Desert dungeons have been largely on rails, stitched together with endless cutscenes of bickering NPCs telling you where to go and what to do.

MiHoYo tested a new vision for Genshin and, according to the posts I saw during 2.8, they got their answer.

1. Some people said the dungeons were difficult to navigate, that they had to look up guides. The mechanics in Fischl's dungeon were finicky. What happens in 3.8? No dungeons. The one big mechanic added was an on-rails rollercoaster.

2. Some people found Xinyan to be a really uninteresting character and didn't care for her backstory. Some people found Fischl annoying. Kazuha's backstory was even hit or miss for a vocal minority, as much of it as we've already seen explored. What happens in 3.8? Not a single characters backstory is ever touched upon. We don't even get Alice checking in on her daughter in 3.8. The characters in the event only react to one another in terms of their base personalities, with no greater understanding of who they are by the end of it.

3. Most every puzzle is '*Go to this place and interact with the thing, or pick up the round peg and put it in the round hole*'. The only real harder variant of any content is three increasingly difficult rollercoaster rides, which were fun but also too few.

4. What you see is what you get. Most every location is used once for a short period of time, no reason to revisit unless you're scooping up treasure chests marked on your map. A number of patches needed to be hotfixed in during 2.8 in response to mobile players difficulty in rendering certain graphics or interfacing with certain mechanics, keeping things simple means less risk of things breaking.

The hit-or-miss reception to 2.8 seems to have lead to a smaller scale, less time investment experience in 3.8.

**Conclusion**: 2.8 wasn't bad content, it was just doing too much in too little a time. It should have just been permanent content instead that stuck around after 2.8 ended, just like the Chasm quest with Itto, Yelan and the gang. 2.8 offered an abundance of content that many casual players were overwhelmed by, having a ticking timer telling them how long they had to explore it all. Every small flaw was magnified by those constraints.

MiHoYo seems disinclined to revisit that sort of content, which I think means they learned the wrong lesson from it. Optional harder puzzles and content are phased out for a steady dripfeed of primogems and characters only get explored in their individual quests, creating a far safer experience but also a far less memorable one.

I still hope they bring back the 2.8 islands as perma-content for those that missed it.",0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/14xmyac/after_completing_38_it_seems_the_28_golden_apple/,07/12/2023,17:16:51,HereForGames,624,Asia

Apple,r/Apple Blackout: What happened,"r/Apple Blackout: What happened Hey r/Apple.

It’s been an interesting week. Hot off the heels of WWDC and in the height of beta season, we [took the subreddit private in protest of Reddit’s API changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/142kca6/rapple_will_be_joining_the_blackout_to_protest/) that had large scaling effects. While we are sure most of you have heard the details, we are going to summarize a few of them:

- [Force most 3rd party apps like Apollo to shut down due to ridiculous pricing schemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/)
- [Hinder moderation tools that are vital to subreddit management](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) 
- [Create an accessibility nightmare for blind users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/) 

While we absolutely agree that Reddit has every right to charge for API access, we don’t agree with the absurd amount they are charging (for Apollo it would be 20 million a year). I’m sure some of you will say it’s ironic that a subreddit about Apple _cough_ app store _cough_ is commenting on a company charging its developers a large amount of money. 

[Reddit’s asshole CEO u/spez made it clear that Reddit was not backing down on their changes](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762501/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-interview-protests-blackout) but assured users that apps or tools meant for accessibility will be unharmed along with most moderation tools and bots. While this was great to hear, it still wasn't enough. [So along with hundreds of other subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) including our friends over at r/iPhone, r/iOS, r/AppleWatch, and r/Jailbreak, we decided to stay private indefinitely until Reddit changed course by giving third-party apps a fair price for API access. 

Now you must be wondering, “I’m seeing this post, does that mean they budged?” Unfortunately, the answer is no. You are seeing this post because [Reddit has threatened to open subreddits regardless of mod action and replace entire teams that otherwise refuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/14a5lz5/mod_code_of_conduct_rule_4_2_and_subs_taken/jo9wdol/). We want the best for this community and have no choice but to open it back up — or have it opened for us.

So to summarize: **fuck u/spez, we hope you resign.**

Apple,r/Apple will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit killing 3rd Party Apps such as Apollo,"r/Apple will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit killing 3rd Party Apps such as Apollo #What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface [](/ajwtf ""and everything that goes with it!"").

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

#What's the plan? 

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord  - but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.

3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.

Apple,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,Asia

Apple,Every app on the iPad is subscription based; to do what Apple advertised and use the apps they promote I’m looking at $200+ in recurring monthly app subscriptions…what?,"Every app on the iPad is subscription based; to do what Apple advertised and use the apps they promote I’m looking at $200+ in recurring monthly app subscriptions…what? Between everything trying to dump stuff onto iCloud and every productivity app thinking they’re worth $10 every month, the App Store is fundamentally broken. I don’t have $2400/yr budgeted for home software. Recurring. I’ve $20 and $30 at a time needs. Apps are not my life style, they’re solving a need, usually only one per app. I have iCloud storage, I don’t need to put my notes on your servers and pay you to hold them hostage if I don’t resubscribe after you raise prices, thanks. The free and add supported stuff is never what it should be, for casual users. It’s bait.

Apple needs to get this under control. They won’t, hooking whales is how they make money, but this is our family’s last iPad until things change. 

At bare minimum, Apple needs to put subscriptions, along with the average paid subscription price, at the listing level of the app next to the “GET” button, not buried under “has IAP” and then we have to click j to the store listing and scroll down to the IAP triangle and open that up too. For every single app. That UI pattern is not something that is reasonable.

I’m sure the mods and community will block this, it’s knocking Apple, but the state of the App Store is untenable as a lifelong Apple fan. Tim Cook and crew have the power to show customers they care about making good products, not good profits. They won’t, but boy would it would be nice to feel good about opening my iPad and not like a constant struggle to keep the cost under a reasonable amount per month.",0.973,0.973,0.973,0.973,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/151mfmk/every_app_on_the_ipad_is_subscription_based_to_do/,07/17/2023,05:24:02,MadeByTango,283,Asia

Apple,I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn.,"I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn. So uh, was traveling from Patna to blr on 1st July. I remember the apple pencil being attached to my iPad when I was packing. (Pencil on ipad, and ipad in a thick case)

Then I removed the ipad in the flight to watch a movie and it was missing. I noticed that the zip of the case was open a lil bit

Only two places where the case containing the ipad was removed: 

1) when we were frantically searching for my student ID card just after entering the airport because we thought we had applied student ticket but had not remembered to keep the I'd card w us. So we removed all the contents of our 3 carrybags. Inside my brother's bag was our iPad case which he also removed along with other contents. Maybe it slipped that time?

2) keeping all our electronic devices on the tray so that it can pass through security check scan. That time we removed the entire case along with 3-4 earbuds, another iPad, phones, wallets etc. But i remember placing the tray back in the tray stash and idr seeing my pencil left in it...

These are the only 2 places where it was removed between it being packed in the bag and removed in the flight.

The case of the ipad is thick and cushioned inside for protection. It's unlikely that somehow the pen unattached itself from the strong magnetic hold of the ipad and then slipped out of the case's zip...

My dad thinks MAYBE it fell in the flight WHILE I was removing it from the case. So I called up indigo lost and found and did file a missing item, but idk what will happen :(

I needed that pencil as my college is gonna start soon. Yeah I can buy a knockoff on Amazon but I feel so bad for misplacing it. It's like a mystery, we're just not able to figure out where it might have slipped.

Thanks for listening lol

Apple,"Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong?","Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong? I’m in my early 20’s in college and devout about 70% of my paycheck into 5 stocks, like the title says: TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, and APPL.

Why does this feel like a both good and bad long term strategy of investing? On one side, I can’t see these stocks going anywhere, tech only will expand, and even if tech stocks crash, these stocks seem to be able to extend beyond just “tech”, ie TSLA with cars, AMZN with grocery stores, APPL with, well, phones and computers, Microsoft seemingly expanding to being a company that branches far past tech, and even Google even though operation as a search engine seems to have and will continue to cement themselves as a leading corporation in America.

Of course, I’m not saying anything special. I’m just wondering, is this a foolish plan? I know diversification is important, but it seems just dumping as much as I can in these stocks for the next 20 years is a solid investment strategy that should enable me to become financially free and eligible for retirement by 40.

It’s honestly nice not having to research new companies and hope my research pans out. Just dumping my money in these already established companies and believing that they’re going to be even bigger and more importantly still around and operating in profit in 20 years makes my investment strategy feel easy and relaxing. Yet, is it supposed to feel this easy?

Apple,Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra,"Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra I have loved my Ultra, it's a fantastic watch. I've been wearing it from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep, and sometimes while I sleep since last September, so for nearly a year now. 

The reason I stopped wearing it is because my left wrist has a noticeable ""divot"", or shallow depression where the sensor bulge sits on my wrist. It's hard to see in photos but easy to notice simply by pinching both wrists. Yes I know it's not my dominant arm but it's too noticeable to ignore. Honestly it freaked me out when I first noticed it.

The main issue with the Ultra is that it's a beast. For me I think it's just too big. I truly wish Apple would make an ""Apple Watch Slim"" with all the same functionality except the fitness features and without the sensor bulge. Imagine the battery life improvement you'd get without the sensors and lights running constantly. And SUCH a better form factor.

Apple,"Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024","Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024 Apple has been relatively quiet on the generative AI front in recent months, which makes them a relative anomaly as Meta, Microsoft, and more all duke it out for the future of AI.

The relative silence doesn't mean Apple hasn't been doing anything, and [today's Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google) (note: paywalled) sheds light on their master plan: they're quietly but ambitiously laying the groundwork for some major moves in AI in 2024.

**Driving the news:**

* **Apple is internally testing a chatbot dubbed ""Apple GPT"" right now.** After being caught ""flat-footed"" by ChatGPT, they're playing catch up.
* **The company has also built a framework for creating LLMs, dubbed ""Ajax"".** Ajax is designed to accelerate Apple's ability to move quickly on the generative AI front heading into next year. Their overall plans are not public, but the leak about Ajax is a confirmation their ambition is wide in scope.

**Why this matters:** trillions of dollars in market cap are at stake.

* **While Apple has moved ahead with imbuing their products with AI** (maps, search, photos etc.), they're worried about losing the race in generative AI.
* **Their cautious approach towards AI and privacy means products like Siri have stagnated,** giving up their early mover advantage in the assistant space.
* **Apple regards generative AI as a ""paramount shift in how devices operate,""** and see this as an existential threat to the company's ability to sell devices.

**What is Tim Cook saying?**

* **In a recent interview, he acknowledged he's using ChatGPT.** It's something Apple is ""looking at closely,"" he confirmed
* **But overall Cook remains cautious:** Generative AI has a ""number of issues that need to be sorted,"" he said as recently as May.

**The main takeaway:** 

* Apple's recent previews of their Vision Pro show that they really want to get something right, in a way that can exceed existing consumer expectations. 
* If their release of generative AI tech to consumers doesn't turn out like Apple Maps did (a complete disaster of a launch), things could get very interesting in the LLM space. 
* BUT: Apple is under the gun here. The AI space is moving fast, and they don't have years of time to get things right.

**P.S. If you like this kind of analysis,** I write [a free newsletter](https://artisana.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=chatgpt) that tracks the biggest issues and implications of generative AI tech. It's sent once a week and helps you stay up-to-date in the time it takes to have your morning coffee.

Apple,"After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward.","After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward. MiHoYo hasn't been shy about using events as a sort of playground to experiment with upcoming mechanics. Very few weekly or monthly events aren't testing something MiHoYo either intends to implement in the near future for Genshin, or for another game they're developing. Such as photography battle event testing out Nahida's E skill, or the stall management minigame from the Weinlesefest festival ending up an entire major monthly content release in Honkai Star Rail. Even Sorush in the Sumeru desert seems to control suspiciously to how underwater gameplay might.

So, what did the 2.8 Apple Islands experiment with?

1. More traditional, major dungeons filled with traditional RPG mechanics, at many points open ended in exploration.

2. Exploring character backstories outside of character story quests.

3. More complex puzzles with solutions not immediately apparent. Typically unlocking these harder variants as optional content after beating the islands dungeon.

4. Huge set piece mechanisms in the overworld to interface with. Kazuha's island to reshape, mix-and-match. Xinyan's rising and falling mountains. Mona's past, present and future transportation circles, alongside the many starbits to find. Enough content on each island to need days worth of revisiting, if you wanted to do absolutely everything.

Notice the direction that the past year, including the summer event capping off the end of Sumeru, has taken.

Puzzles have all been exceedingly simple, varying between '*Put the round peg in the round hole*' to '*Interact with the glowy icon to proceed*' with a few notable exceptions that aren't found unless you return to the end of the pyramid dungeons after beating them. Desert dungeons have been largely on rails, stitched together with endless cutscenes of bickering NPCs telling you where to go and what to do.

MiHoYo tested a new vision for Genshin and, according to the posts I saw during 2.8, they got their answer.

1. Some people said the dungeons were difficult to navigate, that they had to look up guides. The mechanics in Fischl's dungeon were finicky. What happens in 3.8? No dungeons. The one big mechanic added was an on-rails rollercoaster.

2. Some people found Xinyan to be a really uninteresting character and didn't care for her backstory. Some people found Fischl annoying. Kazuha's backstory was even hit or miss for a vocal minority, as much of it as we've already seen explored. What happens in 3.8? Not a single characters backstory is ever touched upon. We don't even get Alice checking in on her daughter in 3.8. The characters in the event only react to one another in terms of their base personalities, with no greater understanding of who they are by the end of it.

3. Most every puzzle is '*Go to this place and interact with the thing, or pick up the round peg and put it in the round hole*'. The only real harder variant of any content is three increasingly difficult rollercoaster rides, which were fun but also too few.

4. What you see is what you get. Most every location is used once for a short period of time, no reason to revisit unless you're scooping up treasure chests marked on your map. A number of patches needed to be hotfixed in during 2.8 in response to mobile players difficulty in rendering certain graphics or interfacing with certain mechanics, keeping things simple means less risk of things breaking.

The hit-or-miss reception to 2.8 seems to have lead to a smaller scale, less time investment experience in 3.8.

**Conclusion**: 2.8 wasn't bad content, it was just doing too much in too little a time. It should have just been permanent content instead that stuck around after 2.8 ended, just like the Chasm quest with Itto, Yelan and the gang. 2.8 offered an abundance of content that many casual players were overwhelmed by, having a ticking timer telling them how long they had to explore it all. Every small flaw was magnified by those constraints.

MiHoYo seems disinclined to revisit that sort of content, which I think means they learned the wrong lesson from it. Optional harder puzzles and content are phased out for a steady dripfeed of primogems and characters only get explored in their individual quests, creating a far safer experience but also a far less memorable one.

I still hope they bring back the 2.8 islands as perma-content for those that missed it.",0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/14xmyac/after_completing_38_it_seems_the_28_golden_apple/,07/12/2023,17:16:51,HereForGames,624,Other

Apple,r/Apple Blackout: What happened,"r/Apple Blackout: What happened Hey r/Apple.

It’s been an interesting week. Hot off the heels of WWDC and in the height of beta season, we [took the subreddit private in protest of Reddit’s API changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/142kca6/rapple_will_be_joining_the_blackout_to_protest/) that had large scaling effects. While we are sure most of you have heard the details, we are going to summarize a few of them:

- [Force most 3rd party apps like Apollo to shut down due to ridiculous pricing schemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/)
- [Hinder moderation tools that are vital to subreddit management](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) 
- [Create an accessibility nightmare for blind users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/) 

While we absolutely agree that Reddit has every right to charge for API access, we don’t agree with the absurd amount they are charging (for Apollo it would be 20 million a year). I’m sure some of you will say it’s ironic that a subreddit about Apple _cough_ app store _cough_ is commenting on a company charging its developers a large amount of money. 

[Reddit’s asshole CEO u/spez made it clear that Reddit was not backing down on their changes](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762501/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-interview-protests-blackout) but assured users that apps or tools meant for accessibility will be unharmed along with most moderation tools and bots. While this was great to hear, it still wasn't enough. [So along with hundreds of other subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) including our friends over at r/iPhone, r/iOS, r/AppleWatch, and r/Jailbreak, we decided to stay private indefinitely until Reddit changed course by giving third-party apps a fair price for API access. 

Now you must be wondering, “I’m seeing this post, does that mean they budged?” Unfortunately, the answer is no. You are seeing this post because [Reddit has threatened to open subreddits regardless of mod action and replace entire teams that otherwise refuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/14a5lz5/mod_code_of_conduct_rule_4_2_and_subs_taken/jo9wdol/). We want the best for this community and have no choice but to open it back up — or have it opened for us.

So to summarize: **fuck u/spez, we hope you resign.**

Apple,r/Apple will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit killing 3rd Party Apps such as Apollo,"r/Apple will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit killing 3rd Party Apps such as Apollo #What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface [](/ajwtf ""and everything that goes with it!"").

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

#What's the plan? 

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord  - but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.

3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.

Apple,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,Other

Between everything trying to dump stuff onto iCloud and every productivity app thinking they’re worth $10 every month, the App Store is fundamentally broken. I don’t have $2400/yr budgeted for home software. Recurring. I’ve $20 and $30 at a time needs. Apps are not my life style, they’re solving a need, usually only one per app. I have iCloud storage, I don’t need to put my notes on your servers and pay you to hold them hostage if I don’t resubscribe after you raise prices, thanks. The free and add supported stuff is never what it should be, for casual users. It’s bait.

Apple needs to get this under control. They won’t, hooking whales is how they make money, but this is our family’s last iPad until things change. 

At bare minimum, Apple needs to put subscriptions, along with the average paid subscription price, at the listing level of the app next to the “GET” button, not buried under “has IAP” and then we have to click j to the store listing and scroll down to the IAP triangle and open that up too. For every single app. That UI pattern is not something that is reasonable.

I’m sure the mods and community will block this, it’s knocking Apple, but the state of the App Store is untenable as a lifelong Apple fan. Tim Cook and crew have the power to show customers they care about making good products, not good profits. They won’t, but boy would it would be nice to feel good about opening my iPad and not like a constant struggle to keep the cost under a reasonable amount per month.",0.973,0.973,0.973,0.973,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/151mfmk/every_app_on_the_ipad_is_subscription_based_to_do/,07/17/2023,05:24:02,MadeByTango,283,Other

Apple,I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn.,"I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn. So uh, was traveling from Patna to blr on 1st July. I remember the apple pencil being attached to my iPad when I was packing. (Pencil on ipad, and ipad in a thick case)

Then I removed the ipad in the flight to watch a movie and it was missing. I noticed that the zip of the case was open a lil bit

Only two places where the case containing the ipad was removed: 

1) when we were frantically searching for my student ID card just after entering the airport because we thought we had applied student ticket but had not remembered to keep the I'd card w us. So we removed all the contents of our 3 carrybags. Inside my brother's bag was our iPad case which he also removed along with other contents. Maybe it slipped that time?

2) keeping all our electronic devices on the tray so that it can pass through security check scan. That time we removed the entire case along with 3-4 earbuds, another iPad, phones, wallets etc. But i remember placing the tray back in the tray stash and idr seeing my pencil left in it...

These are the only 2 places where it was removed between it being packed in the bag and removed in the flight.

The case of the ipad is thick and cushioned inside for protection. It's unlikely that somehow the pen unattached itself from the strong magnetic hold of the ipad and then slipped out of the case's zip...

My dad thinks MAYBE it fell in the flight WHILE I was removing it from the case. So I called up indigo lost and found and did file a missing item, but idk what will happen :(

I needed that pencil as my college is gonna start soon. Yeah I can buy a knockoff on Amazon but I feel so bad for misplacing it. It's like a mystery, we're just not able to figure out where it might have slipped.

Thanks for listening lol

Apple,"Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong?","Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong? I’m in my early 20’s in college and devout about 70% of my paycheck into 5 stocks, like the title says: TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, and APPL.

Why does this feel like a both good and bad long term strategy of investing? On one side, I can’t see these stocks going anywhere, tech only will expand, and even if tech stocks crash, these stocks seem to be able to extend beyond just “tech”, ie TSLA with cars, AMZN with grocery stores, APPL with, well, phones and computers, Microsoft seemingly expanding to being a company that branches far past tech, and even Google even though operation as a search engine seems to have and will continue to cement themselves as a leading corporation in America.

Of course, I’m not saying anything special. I’m just wondering, is this a foolish plan? I know diversification is important, but it seems just dumping as much as I can in these stocks for the next 20 years is a solid investment strategy that should enable me to become financially free and eligible for retirement by 40.

It’s honestly nice not having to research new companies and hope my research pans out. Just dumping my money in these already established companies and believing that they’re going to be even bigger and more importantly still around and operating in profit in 20 years makes my investment strategy feel easy and relaxing. Yet, is it supposed to feel this easy?

Apple,Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra,"Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra I have loved my Ultra, it's a fantastic watch. I've been wearing it from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep, and sometimes while I sleep since last September, so for nearly a year now. 

The reason I stopped wearing it is because my left wrist has a noticeable ""divot"", or shallow depression where the sensor bulge sits on my wrist. It's hard to see in photos but easy to notice simply by pinching both wrists. Yes I know it's not my dominant arm but it's too noticeable to ignore. Honestly it freaked me out when I first noticed it.

The main issue with the Ultra is that it's a beast. For me I think it's just too big. I truly wish Apple would make an ""Apple Watch Slim"" with all the same functionality except the fitness features and without the sensor bulge. Imagine the battery life improvement you'd get without the sensors and lights running constantly. And SUCH a better form factor. 

Curious if anyone else who's worn their Ultra for as long as I have has noticed this on their wrist. After just a few days of wearing my crappy timex my left wrist is already starting to lose the divot.",0.9455,0.9455,0.9455,0.9455,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/155r8q4/stopped_wearing_my_apple_watch_ultra/,07/21/2023,20:29:10,inorganik,296,Other

Head attacker is Twitch streamer ElZeein.

Edit: 6: 25 UTC, July 22, ElZeein has begun attacking Bad Apple.

Edit: 6: 35 UTC, July 22, the first wave of attack is over. Bad Apple survived and is still ongoing. ElZeein is apparently planning on drawing something on top of the animation.

Edit: 6: 50 UTC, July 22, ElZeein threatened that if his cat (That destroyed Foxhole, Babymetal, and part of r/Save3rdPartyApps ) gets attacked once more, he will wipe out Bad Apple.

Edit: According to  [**u/cheetahound**](https://www.reddit.com/user/cheetahound/) in the comments, ElZeein calls it off because ""he just watched the animation and called it pretty"". However, according to another redditor, u/imtuc ,he promised to strike again. I myself do not know which one is true, since I wasn't there at the time.

Edit: As of 10:45 UTC, July 22, ElZeein's cat has completely disintegrated. Foxhole, Babymetal, and r/Save3rdPartyApps have been restored.

Apple,"Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024","Apple has developed ""Apple GPT"" as it prepares for a major AI push in 2024 Apple has been relatively quiet on the generative AI front in recent months, which makes them a relative anomaly as Meta, Microsoft, and more all duke it out for the future of AI.

The relative silence doesn't mean Apple hasn't been doing anything, and [today's Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google) (note: paywalled) sheds light on their master plan: they're quietly but ambitiously laying the groundwork for some major moves in AI in 2024.

**Driving the news:**

* **Apple is internally testing a chatbot dubbed ""Apple GPT"" right now.** After being caught ""flat-footed"" by ChatGPT, they're playing catch up.
* **The company has also built a framework for creating LLMs, dubbed ""Ajax"".** Ajax is designed to accelerate Apple's ability to move quickly on the generative AI front heading into next year. Their overall plans are not public, but the leak about Ajax is a confirmation their ambition is wide in scope.

**Why this matters:** trillions of dollars in market cap are at stake.

* **While Apple has moved ahead with imbuing their products with AI** (maps, search, photos etc.), they're worried about losing the race in generative AI.
* **Their cautious approach towards AI and privacy means products like Siri have stagnated,** giving up their early mover advantage in the assistant space.
* **Apple regards generative AI as a ""paramount shift in how devices operate,""** and see this as an existential threat to the company's ability to sell devices.

**What is Tim Cook saying?**

* **In a recent interview, he acknowledged he's using ChatGPT.** It's something Apple is ""looking at closely,"" he confirmed
* **But overall Cook remains cautious:** Generative AI has a ""number of issues that need to be sorted,"" he said as recently as May.

**The main takeaway:** 

* Apple's recent previews of their Vision Pro show that they really want to get something right, in a way that can exceed existing consumer expectations. 
* If their release of generative AI tech to consumers doesn't turn out like Apple Maps did (a complete disaster of a launch), things could get very interesting in the LLM space. 
* BUT: Apple is under the gun here. The AI space is moving fast, and they don't have years of time to get things right.

**P.S. If you like this kind of analysis,** I write [a free newsletter](https://artisana.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=chatgpt) that tracks the biggest issues and implications of generative AI tech. It's sent once a week and helps you stay up-to-date in the time it takes to have your morning coffee.

Apple,"After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward.","After completing 3.8, it seems the 2.8 Golden Apple Archipelago was a test to see how the playerbase would react to certain types of content and reshaped the game moving forward. MiHoYo hasn't been shy about using events as a sort of playground to experiment with upcoming mechanics. Very few weekly or monthly events aren't testing something MiHoYo either intends to implement in the near future for Genshin, or for another game they're developing. Such as photography battle event testing out Nahida's E skill, or the stall management minigame from the Weinlesefest festival ending up an entire major monthly content release in Honkai Star Rail. Even Sorush in the Sumeru desert seems to control suspiciously to how underwater gameplay might.

So, what did the 2.8 Apple Islands experiment with?

1. More traditional, major dungeons filled with traditional RPG mechanics, at many points open ended in exploration.

2. Exploring character backstories outside of character story quests.

3. More complex puzzles with solutions not immediately apparent. Typically unlocking these harder variants as optional content after beating the islands dungeon.

4. Huge set piece mechanisms in the overworld to interface with. Kazuha's island to reshape, mix-and-match. Xinyan's rising and falling mountains. Mona's past, present and future transportation circles, alongside the many starbits to find. Enough content on each island to need days worth of revisiting, if you wanted to do absolutely everything.

Notice the direction that the past year, including the summer event capping off the end of Sumeru, has taken.

Puzzles have all been exceedingly simple, varying between '*Put the round peg in the round hole*' to '*Interact with the glowy icon to proceed*' with a few notable exceptions that aren't found unless you return to the end of the pyramid dungeons after beating them. Desert dungeons have been largely on rails, stitched together with endless cutscenes of bickering NPCs telling you where to go and what to do.

MiHoYo tested a new vision for Genshin and, according to the posts I saw during 2.8, they got their answer.

1. Some people said the dungeons were difficult to navigate, that they had to look up guides. The mechanics in Fischl's dungeon were finicky. What happens in 3.8? No dungeons. The one big mechanic added was an on-rails rollercoaster.

2. Some people found Xinyan to be a really uninteresting character and didn't care for her backstory. Some people found Fischl annoying. Kazuha's backstory was even hit or miss for a vocal minority, as much of it as we've already seen explored. What happens in 3.8? Not a single characters backstory is ever touched upon. We don't even get Alice checking in on her daughter in 3.8. The characters in the event only react to one another in terms of their base personalities, with no greater understanding of who they are by the end of it.

3. Most every puzzle is '*Go to this place and interact with the thing, or pick up the round peg and put it in the round hole*'. The only real harder variant of any content is three increasingly difficult rollercoaster rides, which were fun but also too few.

4. What you see is what you get. Most every location is used once for a short period of time, no reason to revisit unless you're scooping up treasure chests marked on your map. A number of patches needed to be hotfixed in during 2.8 in response to mobile players difficulty in rendering certain graphics or interfacing with certain mechanics, keeping things simple means less risk of things breaking.

The hit-or-miss reception to 2.8 seems to have lead to a smaller scale, less time investment experience in 3.8.

**Conclusion**: 2.8 wasn't bad content, it was just doing too much in too little a time. It should have just been permanent content instead that stuck around after 2.8 ended, just like the Chasm quest with Itto, Yelan and the gang. 2.8 offered an abundance of content that many casual players were overwhelmed by, having a ticking timer telling them how long they had to explore it all. Every small flaw was magnified by those constraints.

MiHoYo seems disinclined to revisit that sort of content, which I think means they learned the wrong lesson from it. Optional harder puzzles and content are phased out for a steady dripfeed of primogems and characters only get explored in their individual quests, creating a far safer experience but also a far less memorable one.

I still hope they bring back the 2.8 islands as perma-content for those that missed it.",0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,0.7236,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/14xmyac/after_completing_38_it_seems_the_28_golden_apple/,07/12/2023,17:16:51,HereForGames,624,

Apple,r/Apple Blackout: What happened,"r/Apple Blackout: What happened Hey r/Apple.

It’s been an interesting week. Hot off the heels of WWDC and in the height of beta season, we [took the subreddit private in protest of Reddit’s API changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/142kca6/rapple_will_be_joining_the_blackout_to_protest/) that had large scaling effects. While we are sure most of you have heard the details, we are going to summarize a few of them:

- [Force most 3rd party apps like Apollo to shut down due to ridiculous pricing schemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/)
- [Hinder moderation tools that are vital to subreddit management](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) 
- [Create an accessibility nightmare for blind users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/) 

While we absolutely agree that Reddit has every right to charge for API access, we don’t agree with the absurd amount they are charging (for Apollo it would be 20 million a year). I’m sure some of you will say it’s ironic that a subreddit about Apple _cough_ app store _cough_ is commenting on a company charging its developers a large amount of money. 

[Reddit’s asshole CEO u/spez made it clear that Reddit was not backing down on their changes](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762501/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-interview-protests-blackout) but assured users that apps or tools meant for accessibility will be unharmed along with most moderation tools and bots. While this was great to hear, it still wasn't enough. [So along with hundreds of other subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) including our friends over at r/iPhone, r/iOS, r/AppleWatch, and r/Jailbreak, we decided to stay private indefinitely until Reddit changed course by giving third-party apps a fair price for API access. 

Now you must be wondering, “I’m seeing this post, does that mean they budged?” Unfortunately, the answer is no. You are seeing this post because [Reddit has threatened to open subreddits regardless of mod action and replace entire teams that otherwise refuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/14a5lz5/mod_code_of_conduct_rule_4_2_and_subs_taken/jo9wdol/). We want the best for this community and have no choice but to open it back up — or have it opened for us.

So to summarize: **fuck u/spez, we hope you resign.**

Apple,r/Apple will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit killing 3rd Party Apps such as Apollo,"r/Apple will be joining the blackout to protest Reddit killing 3rd Party Apps such as Apollo #What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface [](/ajwtf ""and everything that goes with it!"").

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

#What's the plan? 

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord  - but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.

3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.

Apple,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,

Apple,Every app on the iPad is subscription based; to do what Apple advertised and use the apps they promote I’m looking at $200+ in recurring monthly app subscriptions…what?,"Every app on the iPad is subscription based; to do what Apple advertised and use the apps they promote I’m looking at $200+ in recurring monthly app subscriptions…what? Between everything trying to dump stuff onto iCloud and every productivity app thinking they’re worth $10 every month, the App Store is fundamentally broken. I don’t have $2400/yr budgeted for home software. Recurring. I’ve $20 and $30 at a time needs. Apps are not my life style, they’re solving a need, usually only one per app. I have iCloud storage, I don’t need to put my notes on your servers and pay you to hold them hostage if I don’t resubscribe after you raise prices, thanks. The free and add supported stuff is never what it should be, for casual users. It’s bait.

Apple needs to get this under control. They won’t, hooking whales is how they make money, but this is our family’s last iPad until things change. 

At bare minimum, Apple needs to put subscriptions, along with the average paid subscription price, at the listing level of the app next to the “GET” button, not buried under “has IAP” and then we have to click j to the store listing and scroll down to the IAP triangle and open that up too. For every single app. That UI pattern is not something that is reasonable.

I’m sure the mods and community will block this, it’s knocking Apple, but the state of the App Store is untenable as a lifelong Apple fan. Tim Cook and crew have the power to show customers they care about making good products, not good profits. They won’t, but boy would it would be nice to feel good about opening my iPad and not like a constant struggle to keep the cost under a reasonable amount per month.",0.973,0.973,0.973,0.973,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/151mfmk/every_app_on_the_ipad_is_subscription_based_to_do/,07/17/2023,05:24:02,MadeByTango,283,

Apple,I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn.,"I lost my apple pencil worth 11k and i feel so fucking guilty rn. So uh, was traveling from Patna to blr on 1st July. I remember the apple pencil being attached to my iPad when I was packing. (Pencil on ipad, and ipad in a thick case)

Then I removed the ipad in the flight to watch a movie and it was missing. I noticed that the zip of the case was open a lil bit

Only two places where the case containing the ipad was removed: 

1) when we were frantically searching for my student ID card just after entering the airport because we thought we had applied student ticket but had not remembered to keep the I'd card w us. So we removed all the contents of our 3 carrybags. Inside my brother's bag was our iPad case which he also removed along with other contents. Maybe it slipped that time?

2) keeping all our electronic devices on the tray so that it can pass through security check scan. That time we removed the entire case along with 3-4 earbuds, another iPad, phones, wallets etc. But i remember placing the tray back in the tray stash and idr seeing my pencil left in it...

These are the only 2 places where it was removed between it being packed in the bag and removed in the flight.

The case of the ipad is thick and cushioned inside for protection. It's unlikely that somehow the pen unattached itself from the strong magnetic hold of the ipad and then slipped out of the case's zip...

My dad thinks MAYBE it fell in the flight WHILE I was removing it from the case. So I called up indigo lost and found and did file a missing item, but idk what will happen :(

I needed that pencil as my college is gonna start soon. Yeah I can buy a knockoff on Amazon but I feel so bad for misplacing it. It's like a mystery, we're just not able to figure out where it might have slipped.

Thanks for listening lol

Apple,"Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong?","Using TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, APPL as my makeshift 401k. In theory, what could go wrong? I’m in my early 20’s in college and devout about 70% of my paycheck into 5 stocks, like the title says: TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, and APPL.

Why does this feel like a both good and bad long term strategy of investing? On one side, I can’t see these stocks going anywhere, tech only will expand, and even if tech stocks crash, these stocks seem to be able to extend beyond just “tech”, ie TSLA with cars, AMZN with grocery stores, APPL with, well, phones and computers, Microsoft seemingly expanding to being a company that branches far past tech, and even Google even though operation as a search engine seems to have and will continue to cement themselves as a leading corporation in America.

Of course, I’m not saying anything special. I’m just wondering, is this a foolish plan? I know diversification is important, but it seems just dumping as much as I can in these stocks for the next 20 years is a solid investment strategy that should enable me to become financially free and eligible for retirement by 40.

It’s honestly nice not having to research new companies and hope my research pans out. Just dumping my money in these already established companies and believing that they’re going to be even bigger and more importantly still around and operating in profit in 20 years makes my investment strategy feel easy and relaxing. Yet, is it supposed to feel this easy?

Apple,Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra,"Stopped wearing my Apple Watch Ultra I have loved my Ultra, it's a fantastic watch. I've been wearing it from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep, and sometimes while I sleep since last September, so for nearly a year now. 

The reason I stopped wearing it is because my left wrist has a noticeable ""divot"", or shallow depression where the sensor bulge sits on my wrist. It's hard to see in photos but easy to notice simply by pinching both wrists. Yes I know it's not my dominant arm but it's too noticeable to ignore. Honestly it freaked me out when I first noticed it.

The main issue with the Ultra is that it's a beast. For me I think it's just too big. I truly wish Apple would make an ""Apple Watch Slim"" with all the same functionality except the fitness features and without the sensor bulge. Imagine the battery life improvement you'd get without the sensors and lights running constantly. And SUCH a better form factor. 

Curious if anyone else who's worn their Ultra for as long as I have has noticed this on their wrist.

 Markets function best with absolute transparency on treating data as a way to be able to determine correct prices at market forces. Chairman Gensler continues to make progress on making more transparent and fair markets by addressing market maker, loopholes that lead to abuse and historic fines.

As an individual investor, at times, it feels like Congress is at the behest of institutional money in opposition of retail investors. This dereliction of duty by members of Congress should not be allowed to make its way into the regulatory framework of the SEC.

While we all know that a Switch 2, Switch Pro, Switch Electric Boogaloo is in development,  Judge Corleys ruling mentions that CoD is currently planned to come to the (new) in development Switch model, indicating that whatever comes next will likely be a ""Switch"" as everyone suspected .

Microsoft,"Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough""","Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough"" AI models need increasingly unique and sophisticated data sets to improve their performance, but the developers behind major LLMs are finding that web data is ""no longer good enough"" and getting ""extremely expensive,"" [a report from the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/053ee253-820e-453a-a1d5-0f24985258de) (note: paywalled) reveals. 

So OpenAI, Microsoft, and Cohere are all actively exploring the use of synthetic data to save on costs and generate clean, high-quality data.

**Why this matters:**

* **Major LLM creators believe they have reached the limits of human-made data improving performance.** The next dramatic leap in performance may not come from just feeding models more web-scraped data.
* **Custom human-created data is extremely expensive and not a scalable solution.** Getting experts in various fields to create additional finely detailed content is unviable at the quantity of data needed to train AI.
* **Web data is increasingly under lock and key,** as sites like Reddit, Twitter, more are charging hefty fees in order to use their data.

**The approach is to have AI generate its own training data go-forward:**

* Cohere is having two AI models act as tutor and student to generate synthetic data. All of it is reviewed by a human at this point.
* Microsoft's research team has shown that certain synthetic data can be used to train smaller models effectively -- but increasing GPT-4 performance's is still not viable with synthetic data.
* Startups like [Scale.ai](https://Scale.ai) and [Gretel.ai](https://Gretel.ai) are already offering synthetic data-as-a-service, showing there's market appetite for this.

**What are AI leaders saying? They're determined to explore this future.**

* **Sam Altman explained in May that he was “pretty confident that soon all data will be synthetic data,”** which could help OpenAI sidestep privacy concerns in the EU. The pathway to superintelligence, he posited, is through models teaching themselves.
* **Aidan Gomez, CEO of LLM startup Cohere, believes web data is not great:** ""the web is so noisy and messy that it’s not really representative of the data that you want. The web just doesn’t do everything we need.""

**Some AI researches are urging caution, however:** researchers from Oxford and Cambridge recently found that training AI models on their own raw outputs risked creating ""irreversible defects"" in these models that could corrupt and degrade their performance over time.

**The main takeaway:** Human-made content was used to develop the first generations of LLMs. But we're now entering a fascinating world where the over the next decade, human-created content could become truly rare, with the bulk of the world's data and content all created by AI.

Microsoft,[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion,"[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion Hi Everyone,

I appreciate that there is a number of things being leaked from emails and/or statements in court that are providing some juicy answers to rumours, or providing us with new information on existing ones. In an effort to avoid the sub being overrun with the emerging information we decided to create this Megathread!

Feel free to use this for discussion on the case when they are on going, or if any new information is leaked/rumoured coming out of it. I will try to update this post with headline information as the days go on. Any new posts made after this Megathread has been posted will be removed and directed here

As previously mentioned in our last mod post, we are cracking down harder on console warring/toxicity we understand that things can get heated, but please be tolerant of other peoples opinions, it is not acceptable to resort to insulting other people. If you feel people are being toxic/console warring report it and we will check it out

&#x200B;

As Microsoft continued its argumentation in the legal trial with the Federal Trade Commission, more and more previously unknown information has been coming to the forefront, and one of the latest and most intriguing pieces of is that Sony may be sitting on an actual PlayStation 5 Slim console. More interesting still is the fact that Microsoft may have leaked its pricing model and release window, to boot.

&#x200B;

The potential existence of a PS5 Slim isn't necessarily the biggest FTC v. Microsoft bombshell, it's worth pointing out. Xbox and PlayStation have laid almost everything bare for the sake of the injunction hearing. What was once supposed to be a simple, albeit substantial business deal, has now turned into one of the biggest legal clashes of recent years, and it's not winding down just yet..

Microsoft,"Nancy Pelosi's husband just snapped up $2.6 million of Apple and Microsoft stock, closing out an options bet that the shares would soar","Nancy Pelosi's husband just snapped up $2.6 million of Apple and Microsoft stock, closing out an options bet that the shares would soar * Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month.
* Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.
* Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                       

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.  
  
The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.  
  
The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.  
  
Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.  
  
First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.  
  
Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.  
  
Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.  
  
Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.  
  
For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.  
  
However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.  
  
OpenSecrets estimated that Pelosi has a net worth of $114.6 million.",0.3182,0.3182,0.3182,0.3182,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14k8vwr/nancy_pelosis_husband_just_snapped_up_26_million/,06/27/2023,14:34:17,No_Cow1,386,Americas

 Markets function best with absolute transparency on treating data as a way to be able to determine correct prices at market forces. Chairman Gensler continues to make progress on making more transparent and fair markets by addressing market maker, loopholes that lead to abuse and historic fines.

As an individual investor, at times, it feels like Congress is at the behest of institutional money in opposition of retail investors. This dereliction of duty by members of Congress should not be allowed to make its way into the regulatory framework of the SEC.

Microsoft,"Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough""","Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough"" AI models need increasingly unique and sophisticated data sets to improve their performance, but the developers behind major LLMs are finding that web data is ""no longer good enough"" and getting ""extremely expensive,"" [a report from the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/053ee253-820e-453a-a1d5-0f24985258de) (note: paywalled) reveals. 

So OpenAI, Microsoft, and Cohere are all actively exploring the use of synthetic data to save on costs and generate clean, high-quality data.

**Why this matters:**

* **Major LLM creators believe they have reached the limits of human-made data improving performance.** The next dramatic leap in performance may not come from just feeding models more web-scraped data.
* **Custom human-created data is extremely expensive and not a scalable solution.** Getting experts in various fields to create additional finely detailed content is unviable at the quantity of data needed to train AI.
* **Web data is increasingly under lock and key,** as sites like Reddit, Twitter, more are charging hefty fees in order to use their data.

**The approach is to have AI generate its own training data go-forward:**

* Cohere is having two AI models act as tutor and student to generate synthetic data. All of it is reviewed by a human at this point.
* Microsoft's research team has shown that certain synthetic data can be used to train smaller models effectively -- but increasing GPT-4 performance's is still not viable with synthetic data.
* Startups like [Scale.ai](https://Scale.ai) and [Gretel.ai](https://Gretel.ai) are already offering synthetic data-as-a-service, showing there's market appetite for this.

**What are AI leaders saying? They're determined to explore this future.**

* **Sam Altman explained in May that he was “pretty confident that soon all data will be synthetic data,”** which could help OpenAI sidestep privacy concerns in the EU. The pathway to superintelligence, he posited, is through models teaching themselves.
* **Aidan Gomez, CEO of LLM startup Cohere, believes web data is not great:** ""the web is so noisy and messy that it’s not really representative of the data that you want. The web just doesn’t do everything we need.""

**Some AI researches are urging caution, however:** researchers from Oxford and Cambridge recently found that training AI models on their own raw outputs risked creating ""irreversible defects"" in these models that could corrupt and degrade their performance over time.

**The main takeaway:** Human-made content was used to develop the first generations of LLMs. But we're now entering a fascinating world where the over the next decade, human-created content could become truly rare, with the bulk of the world's data and content all created by AI. 

**P.S. If you like this kind of analysis,** I write [a free newsletter](https://artisana.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=chatgpt) that tracks the biggest issues and implications of generative AI tech. It's sent once a week and helps you stay up-to-date in the time it takes to have your morning coffee.

Microsoft,[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion,"[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion Hi Everyone,

I appreciate that there is a number of things being leaked from emails and/or statements in court that are providing some juicy answers to rumours, or providing us with new information on existing ones. In an effort to avoid the sub being overrun with the emerging information we decided to create this Megathread!

Feel free to use this for discussion on the case when they are on going, or if any new information is leaked/rumoured coming out of it. I will try to update this post with headline information as the days go on. Any new posts made after this Megathread has been posted will be removed and directed here

As previously mentioned in our last mod post, we are cracking down harder on console warring/toxicity we understand that things can get heated, but please be tolerant of other peoples opinions, it is not acceptable to resort to insulting other people. If you feel people are being toxic/console warring report it and we will check it out

&#x200B;

As Microsoft continued its argumentation in the legal trial with the Federal Trade Commission, more and more previously unknown information has been coming to the forefront, and one of the latest and most intriguing pieces of is that Sony may be sitting on an actual PlayStation 5 Slim console. More interesting still is the fact that Microsoft may have leaked its pricing model and release window, to boot.

&#x200B;

The potential existence of a PS5 Slim isn't necessarily the biggest FTC v. Microsoft bombshell, it's worth pointing out. Xbox and PlayStation have laid almost everything bare for the sake of the injunction hearing. What was once supposed to be a simple, albeit substantial business deal, has now turned into one of the biggest legal clashes of recent years, and it's not winding down just yet..

* Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.
* Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                       

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.  
  
The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.  
  
The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.  
  
Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.  
  
First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.  
  
Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.  
  
Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.  
  
Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.  
  
For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.  
  
However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.

 Markets function best with absolute transparency on treating data as a way to be able to determine correct prices at market forces. Chairman Gensler continues to make progress on making more transparent and fair markets by addressing market maker, loopholes that lead to abuse and historic fines.

As an individual investor, at times, it feels like Congress is at the behest of institutional money in opposition of retail investors. This dereliction of duty by members of Congress should not be allowed to make its way into the regulatory framework of the SEC.

Microsoft,"Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough""","Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough"" AI models need increasingly unique and sophisticated data sets to improve their performance, but the developers behind major LLMs are finding that web data is ""no longer good enough"" and getting ""extremely expensive,"" [a report from the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/053ee253-820e-453a-a1d5-0f24985258de) (note: paywalled) reveals. 

So OpenAI, Microsoft, and Cohere are all actively exploring the use of synthetic data to save on costs and generate clean, high-quality data.

**Why this matters:**

* **Major LLM creators believe they have reached the limits of human-made data improving performance.** The next dramatic leap in performance may not come from just feeding models more web-scraped data.
* **Custom human-created data is extremely expensive and not a scalable solution.** Getting experts in various fields to create additional finely detailed content is unviable at the quantity of data needed to train AI.
* **Web data is increasingly under lock and key,** as sites like Reddit, Twitter, more are charging hefty fees in order to use their data.

**The approach is to have AI generate its own training data go-forward:**

* Cohere is having two AI models act as tutor and student to generate synthetic data. All of it is reviewed by a human at this point.
* Microsoft's research team has shown that certain synthetic data can be used to train smaller models effectively -- but increasing GPT-4 performance's is still not viable with synthetic data.
* Startups like [Scale.ai](https://Scale.ai) and [Gretel.ai](https://Gretel.ai) are already offering synthetic data-as-a-service, showing there's market appetite for this.

**What are AI leaders saying? They're determined to explore this future.**

* **Sam Altman explained in May that he was “pretty confident that soon all data will be synthetic data,”** which could help OpenAI sidestep privacy concerns in the EU. The pathway to superintelligence, he posited, is through models teaching themselves.
* **Aidan Gomez, CEO of LLM startup Cohere, believes web data is not great:** ""the web is so noisy and messy that it’s not really representative of the data that you want. The web just doesn’t do everything we need.""

**Some AI researches are urging caution, however:** researchers from Oxford and Cambridge recently found that training AI models on their own raw outputs risked creating ""irreversible defects"" in these models that could corrupt and degrade their performance over time.

**The main takeaway:** Human-made content was used to develop the first generations of LLMs. But we're now entering a fascinating world where the over the next decade, human-created content could become truly rare, with the bulk of the world's data and content all created by AI. 

**P.S.

Microsoft,[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion,"[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion Hi Everyone,

I appreciate that there is a number of things being leaked from emails and/or statements in court that are providing some juicy answers to rumours, or providing us with new information on existing ones. In an effort to avoid the sub being overrun with the emerging information we decided to create this Megathread!

Feel free to use this for discussion on the case when they are on going, or if any new information is leaked/rumoured coming out of it. I will try to update this post with headline information as the days go on. Any new posts made after this Megathread has been posted will be removed and directed here

As previously mentioned in our last mod post, we are cracking down harder on console warring/toxicity we understand that things can get heated, but please be tolerant of other peoples opinions, it is not acceptable to resort to insulting other people. If you feel people are being toxic/console warring report it and we will check it out

&#x200B;

As Microsoft continued its argumentation in the legal trial with the Federal Trade Commission, more and more previously unknown information has been coming to the forefront, and one of the latest and most intriguing pieces of is that Sony may be sitting on an actual PlayStation 5 Slim console. More interesting still is the fact that Microsoft may have leaked its pricing model and release window, to boot.

&#x200B;

The potential existence of a PS5 Slim isn't necessarily the biggest FTC v. Microsoft bombshell, it's worth pointing out. Xbox and PlayStation have laid almost everything bare for the sake of the injunction hearing. What was once supposed to be a simple, albeit substantial business deal, has now turned into one of the biggest legal clashes of recent years, and it's not winding down just yet..

* Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.
* Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                       

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.  
  
The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.  
  
The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.  
  
Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.  
  
First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.  
  
Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.  
  
Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.  
  
Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.  
  
For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.  
  
However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.

 Markets function best with absolute transparency on treating data as a way to be able to determine correct prices at market forces. Chairman Gensler continues to make progress on making more transparent and fair markets by addressing market maker, loopholes that lead to abuse and historic fines.

As an individual investor, at times, it feels like Congress is at the behest of institutional money in opposition of retail investors. This dereliction of duty by members of Congress should not be allowed to make its way into the regulatory framework of the SEC.

Microsoft,"Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough""","Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough"" AI models need increasingly unique and sophisticated data sets to improve their performance, but the developers behind major LLMs are finding that web data is ""no longer good enough"" and getting ""extremely expensive,"" [a report from the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/053ee253-820e-453a-a1d5-0f24985258de) (note: paywalled) reveals. 

So OpenAI, Microsoft, and Cohere are all actively exploring the use of synthetic data to save on costs and generate clean, high-quality data.

**Why this matters:**

* **Major LLM creators believe they have reached the limits of human-made data improving performance.** The next dramatic leap in performance may not come from just feeding models more web-scraped data.
* **Custom human-created data is extremely expensive and not a scalable solution.** Getting experts in various fields to create additional finely detailed content is unviable at the quantity of data needed to train AI.
* **Web data is increasingly under lock and key,** as sites like Reddit, Twitter, more are charging hefty fees in order to use their data.

**The approach is to have AI generate its own training data go-forward:**

* Cohere is having two AI models act as tutor and student to generate synthetic data. All of it is reviewed by a human at this point.
* Microsoft's research team has shown that certain synthetic data can be used to train smaller models effectively -- but increasing GPT-4 performance's is still not viable with synthetic data.
* Startups like [Scale.ai](https://Scale.ai) and [Gretel.ai](https://Gretel.ai) are already offering synthetic data-as-a-service, showing there's market appetite for this.

**What are AI leaders saying? They're determined to explore this future.**

* **Sam Altman explained in May that he was “pretty confident that soon all data will be synthetic data,”** which could help OpenAI sidestep privacy concerns in the EU. The pathway to superintelligence, he posited, is through models teaching themselves.
* **Aidan Gomez, CEO of LLM startup Cohere, believes web data is not great:** ""the web is so noisy and messy that it’s not really representative of the data that you want. The web just doesn’t do everything we need.""

**Some AI researches are urging caution, however:** researchers from Oxford and Cambridge recently found that training AI models on their own raw outputs risked creating ""irreversible defects"" in these models that could corrupt and degrade their performance over time.

**The main takeaway:** Human-made content was used to develop the first generations of LLMs. But we're now entering a fascinating world where the over the next decade, human-created content could become truly rare, with the bulk of the world's data and content all created by AI. 

**P.S.

Microsoft,[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion,"[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion Hi Everyone,

I appreciate that there is a number of things being leaked from emails and/or statements in court that are providing some juicy answers to rumours, or providing us with new information on existing ones. In an effort to avoid the sub being overrun with the emerging information we decided to create this Megathread!

Feel free to use this for discussion on the case when they are on going, or if any new information is leaked/rumoured coming out of it. I will try to update this post with headline information as the days go on. Any new posts made after this Megathread has been posted will be removed and directed here

As previously mentioned in our last mod post, we are cracking down harder on console warring/toxicity we understand that things can get heated, but please be tolerant of other peoples opinions, it is not acceptable to resort to insulting other people. If you feel people are being toxic/console warring report it and we will check it out

&#x200B;

As Microsoft continued its argumentation in the legal trial with the Federal Trade Commission, more and more previously unknown information has been coming to the forefront, and one of the latest and most intriguing pieces of is that Sony may be sitting on an actual PlayStation 5 Slim console. More interesting still is the fact that Microsoft may have leaked its pricing model and release window, to boot.

&#x200B;

The potential existence of a PS5 Slim isn't necessarily the biggest FTC v. Microsoft bombshell, it's worth pointing out. Xbox and PlayStation have laid almost everything bare for the sake of the injunction hearing. What was once supposed to be a simple, albeit substantial business deal, has now turned into one of the biggest legal clashes of recent years, and it's not winding down just yet..

* Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.
* Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                       

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.  
  
The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.  
  
The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.  
  
Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.  
  
First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.  
  
Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.  
  
Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.  
  
Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.  
  
For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.  
  
However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.

 Markets function best with absolute transparency on treating data as a way to be able to determine correct prices at market forces. Chairman Gensler continues to make progress on making more transparent and fair markets by addressing market maker, loopholes that lead to abuse and historic fines.

As an individual investor, at times, it feels like Congress is at the behest of institutional money in opposition of retail investors. This dereliction of duty by members of Congress should not be allowed to make its way into the regulatory framework of the SEC.

Microsoft,"Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough""","Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough"" AI models need increasingly unique and sophisticated data sets to improve their performance, but the developers behind major LLMs are finding that web data is ""no longer good enough"" and getting ""extremely expensive,"" [a report from the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/053ee253-820e-453a-a1d5-0f24985258de) (note: paywalled) reveals. 

So OpenAI, Microsoft, and Cohere are all actively exploring the use of synthetic data to save on costs and generate clean, high-quality data.

**Why this matters:**

* **Major LLM creators believe they have reached the limits of human-made data improving performance.** The next dramatic leap in performance may not come from just feeding models more web-scraped data.
* **Custom human-created data is extremely expensive and not a scalable solution.** Getting experts in various fields to create additional finely detailed content is unviable at the quantity of data needed to train AI.
* **Web data is increasingly under lock and key,** as sites like Reddit, Twitter, more are charging hefty fees in order to use their data.

**The approach is to have AI generate its own training data go-forward:**

* Cohere is having two AI models act as tutor and student to generate synthetic data. All of it is reviewed by a human at this point.
* Microsoft's research team has shown that certain synthetic data can be used to train smaller models effectively -- but increasing GPT-4 performance's is still not viable with synthetic data.
* Startups like [Scale.ai](https://Scale.ai) and [Gretel.ai](https://Gretel.ai) are already offering synthetic data-as-a-service, showing there's market appetite for this.

**What are AI leaders saying? They're determined to explore this future.**

* **Sam Altman explained in May that he was “pretty confident that soon all data will be synthetic data,”** which could help OpenAI sidestep privacy concerns in the EU. The pathway to superintelligence, he posited, is through models teaching themselves.
* **Aidan Gomez, CEO of LLM startup Cohere, believes web data is not great:** ""the web is so noisy and messy that it’s not really representative of the data that you want. The web just doesn’t do everything we need.""

**Some AI researches are urging caution, however:** researchers from Oxford and Cambridge recently found that training AI models on their own raw outputs risked creating ""irreversible defects"" in these models that could corrupt and degrade their performance over time.

**The main takeaway:** Human-made content was used to develop the first generations of LLMs. But we're now entering a fascinating world where the over the next decade, human-created content could become truly rare, with the bulk of the world's data and content all created by AI.

Microsoft,[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion,"[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion Hi Everyone,

I appreciate that there is a number of things being leaked from emails and/or statements in court that are providing some juicy answers to rumours, or providing us with new information on existing ones. In an effort to avoid the sub being overrun with the emerging information we decided to create this Megathread!

Feel free to use this for discussion on the case when they are on going, or if any new information is leaked/rumoured coming out of it. I will try to update this post with headline information as the days go on. Any new posts made after this Megathread has been posted will be removed and directed here

As previously mentioned in our last mod post, we are cracking down harder on console warring/toxicity we understand that things can get heated, but please be tolerant of other peoples opinions, it is not acceptable to resort to insulting other people. If you feel people are being toxic/console warring report it and we will check it out

&#x200B;

As Microsoft continued its argumentation in the legal trial with the Federal Trade Commission, more and more previously unknown information has been coming to the forefront, and one of the latest and most intriguing pieces of is that Sony may be sitting on an actual PlayStation 5 Slim console. More interesting still is the fact that Microsoft may have leaked its pricing model and release window, to boot.

&#x200B;

The potential existence of a PS5 Slim isn't necessarily the biggest FTC v. Microsoft bombshell, it's worth pointing out. Xbox and PlayStation have laid almost everything bare for the sake of the injunction hearing. What was once supposed to be a simple, albeit substantial business deal, has now turned into one of the biggest legal clashes of recent years, and it's not winding down just yet..

* Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.
* Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                       

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.  
  
The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.  
  
The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.  
  
Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.  
  
First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.  
  
Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.  
  
Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.  
  
Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.  
  
For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.  
  
However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.  
  
OpenSecrets estimated that Pelosi has a net worth of $114.6 million.",0.3182,0.3182,0.3182,0.3182,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14k8vwr/nancy_pelosis_husband_just_snapped_up_26_million/,06/27/2023,14:34:17,No_Cow1,386,Other

 Markets function best with absolute transparency on treating data as a way to be able to determine correct prices at market forces. Chairman Gensler continues to make progress on making more transparent and fair markets by addressing market maker, loopholes that lead to abuse and historic fines.

As an individual investor, at times, it feels like Congress is at the behest of institutional money in opposition of retail investors. This dereliction of duty by members of Congress should not be allowed to make its way into the regulatory framework of the SEC.

Microsoft,"Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough""","Microsoft and OpenAI test synthetic data to train LLMs, as web data is ""no longer good enough"" AI models need increasingly unique and sophisticated data sets to improve their performance, but the developers behind major LLMs are finding that web data is ""no longer good enough"" and getting ""extremely expensive,"" [a report from the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/053ee253-820e-453a-a1d5-0f24985258de) (note: paywalled) reveals. 

So OpenAI, Microsoft, and Cohere are all actively exploring the use of synthetic data to save on costs and generate clean, high-quality data.

**Why this matters:**

* **Major LLM creators believe they have reached the limits of human-made data improving performance.** The next dramatic leap in performance may not come from just feeding models more web-scraped data.
* **Custom human-created data is extremely expensive and not a scalable solution.** Getting experts in various fields to create additional finely detailed content is unviable at the quantity of data needed to train AI.
* **Web data is increasingly under lock and key,** as sites like Reddit, Twitter, more are charging hefty fees in order to use their data.

**The approach is to have AI generate its own training data go-forward:**

* Cohere is having two AI models act as tutor and student to generate synthetic data. All of it is reviewed by a human at this point.
* Microsoft's research team has shown that certain synthetic data can be used to train smaller models effectively -- but increasing GPT-4 performance's is still not viable with synthetic data.
* Startups like [Scale.ai](https://Scale.ai) and [Gretel.ai](https://Gretel.ai) are already offering synthetic data-as-a-service, showing there's market appetite for this.

**What are AI leaders saying? They're determined to explore this future.**

* **Sam Altman explained in May that he was “pretty confident that soon all data will be synthetic data,”** which could help OpenAI sidestep privacy concerns in the EU. The pathway to superintelligence, he posited, is through models teaching themselves.
* **Aidan Gomez, CEO of LLM startup Cohere, believes web data is not great:** ""the web is so noisy and messy that it’s not really representative of the data that you want. The web just doesn’t do everything we need.""

**Some AI researches are urging caution, however:** researchers from Oxford and Cambridge recently found that training AI models on their own raw outputs risked creating ""irreversible defects"" in these models that could corrupt and degrade their performance over time.

**The main takeaway:** Human-made content was used to develop the first generations of LLMs. But we're now entering a fascinating world where the over the next decade, human-created content could become truly rare, with the bulk of the world's data and content all created by AI.

Microsoft,[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion,"[MEGATHREAD] Microsoft & Activision-Blizzard vs FTC discussion Hi Everyone,

I appreciate that there is a number of things being leaked from emails and/or statements in court that are providing some juicy answers to rumours, or providing us with new information on existing ones. In an effort to avoid the sub being overrun with the emerging information we decided to create this Megathread!

Feel free to use this for discussion on the case when they are on going, or if any new information is leaked/rumoured coming out of it. I will try to update this post with headline information as the days go on. Any new posts made after this Megathread has been posted will be removed and directed here

As previously mentioned in our last mod post, we are cracking down harder on console warring/toxicity we understand that things can get heated, but please be tolerant of other peoples opinions, it is not acceptable to resort to insulting other people. If you feel people are being toxic/console warring report it and we will check it out

&#x200B;

As Microsoft continued its argumentation in the legal trial with the Federal Trade Commission, more and more previously unknown information has been coming to the forefront, and one of the latest and most intriguing pieces of is that Sony may be sitting on an actual PlayStation 5 Slim console. More interesting still is the fact that Microsoft may have leaked its pricing model and release window, to boot.

&#x200B;

The potential existence of a PS5 Slim isn't necessarily the biggest FTC v. Microsoft bombshell, it's worth pointing out. Xbox and PlayStation have laid almost everything bare for the sake of the injunction hearing. What was once supposed to be a simple, albeit substantial business deal, has now turned into one of the biggest legal clashes of recent years, and it's not winding down just yet..

* Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.
* Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                       

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.  
  
The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.  
  
The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.  
  
Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.  
  
First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.  
  
Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.  
  
Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.  
  
Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.

Amazon,Dish and Amazon deal 100% happening,"Dish and Amazon deal 100% happening Just searched “Boost Infinite Sim” on amazon, and it brings up an inbuilt ad for the leaked $25 a month plan, the ad links to a 404 page but it will probably go live once the announcement is made. If you don’t believe me just search for it on amazon your self. 

This deal is 100% happening, almost certainly today during trading or right at market close today. 

Last chance to hop on the $8-$9 7/28 call train while options haven’t updated to reflect the news yet.



Edit: Editing my post now just to give a word of warning. I am a regard. I consistently lose money. I usually make a big play that goes well and then slowly lose those gains on smaller plays.
I am down 35% on my port as of yesterday due to a certain movie theater stock. So please do not put money you can’t afford to lose into this play.

**Edit 2: Never mind, I’m literally the next Warren Buffet, fuck you all, I was sooo right, you can suck the turds out my ass hole**

Edit 3: Jobs posting on Dish’s website specifically naming Amazon in the posting. This deal is 100% happening.

Amazon,Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them.,"Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them. I was scammed by Amazon and been denied a refund or my product and therefore I will be suing them.

On July 15th, I ordered my dream laptop off Amazon for a price north of 500£ and south of 1000£. The time of delivery was scheduled to be on the Tuesday 18th July and I was really excited to receive the laptop. However, I was called by the delivery driver at 12.34 and was told that he is in my area and that he would like my personal phone number to contact me after 10 minutes to deliver the parcel. I was a bit weirded out by this but I complied and gave him my phone number. I was never contacted by him again and I received a notification later that said the parcel was delivered. I quickly checked this and sure enough it says parcel handed to customer. This was extremely weird since you need a one-time password to claim the package. This password is sent to you via email an hour before the delivery. This password is needed for the delivery driver to mark it as delivered. I quickly called customer service at 1.54 and the lady I was with called the delivery driver and the driver said that he still has the package. I was then informed that the parcel will arrive between the 18th and the 20th of July and that I shouldn't worry that the parcel is marked as delivered. On 20th of July I called customer service again to tell them that the package hasn't arrived and they told me that it arrived on the 18th at 12.30. I told them that that hadn't happened and that I also called them that day and that they told me to expect it by the 20th. I was told that there will be an investigation that will take 24-48 hours and then I'll be informed of what happened. At this point I didn't care much for the laptop. I just wanted my money back. On the 21st I called them again and they told me that they can't give me a refund or deliver the package since it already has been delivered at 12.30 of the 18th. This clearly didn't happen since I was told on the same day at 1.54 that the delivery driver still had the package. I tried texting customer support 3 more times and I was met with the same response. I screenshotted all the texts and my call log in case they are needed. I also screenshotted the emails from amazon and I decided to pursue this case to get my money or my laptop.

Looking back on it, it seems really obvious that I was scammed by the delivery driver when he asked my phone number and that he somehow accessed my email from that and got the one time password. I have decided to send a copy of the screenshots to the police and to email the head branch of Amazon in Seattle to say that I will be pressing charges.

I am posting this to ask for any more advice regarding this and to check if this scam has happened to any other people and to also warn people to not give any personal info to anyone without ensuring it.

I would also like to clarify that I live in the UK however I do not have the nationality.

Thank you all for reading this and please respond  as any help will be needed in this situation.

EDIT: There seems to be a big understanding about the number thing. The driver called me from an Amazon number and Amazon can't leak my number (due to privacy policy) to the driver so it is hidden. So he doesn't have access to my number  from any other phone. He can only call me from the Amazon device he has. To get my phone number he needed to ask me for it.
Edit 2: Multiple redditors have told me that drivers can use the last 3 digits of your phone number as the OTP. I now realise how he ""hacked"" into my email.

Amazon,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,Americas

Apparently they are doing the ""forced resignations"" verbally. I hope they get a class action suit over this. The only reason to call it quitting is to avoid WARN act and to avoid unemployment insurance. Its totally sleazy.

Amazon,FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon,"FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.

The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors.
The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.

The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.

The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.

In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

we also have amazon lockers so it should have been dropped off there had i not been in.

i asked the phone handler if today's occurrence could have been a mistake from the driver accidentally marking it as delivered, or maybe doing it on purpose to hit their quota for the day without getting into trouble (amazon delivery drivers notoriously have tight targets in regards to timing).

she said this could possibly be the case. i asked her if this was legal. she refused to answer me when i continued to ask her this multiple times.

And everytime I do I specifically check German questions and I always see someone ask something like ""Does this item come with a charger"" and then several people replying with ""I don't know"" or ""I have not received the item"".

It partially annoys me but mostly confuses me why so many Germans reply to questions they don't have a helpful answer to. Their replies are literally pointless.

This deal is 100% happening, almost certainly today during trading or right at market close today. 

Last chance to hop on the $8-$9 7/28 call train while options haven’t updated to reflect the news yet.



Edit: Editing my post now just to give a word of warning. I am a regard. I consistently lose money. I usually make a big play that goes well and then slowly lose those gains on smaller plays.
I am down 35% on my port as of yesterday due to a certain movie theater stock. So please do not put money you can’t afford to lose into this play.

**Edit 2: Never mind, I’m literally the next Warren Buffet, fuck you all, I was sooo right, you can suck the turds out my ass hole**

Edit 3: Jobs posting on Dish’s website specifically naming Amazon in the posting. This deal is 100% happening.

Amazon,Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them.,"Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them. I was scammed by Amazon and been denied a refund or my product and therefore I will be suing them.

On July 15th, I ordered my dream laptop off Amazon for a price north of 500£ and south of 1000£. The time of delivery was scheduled to be on the Tuesday 18th July and I was really excited to receive the laptop. However, I was called by the delivery driver at 12.34 and was told that he is in my area and that he would like my personal phone number to contact me after 10 minutes to deliver the parcel. I was a bit weirded out by this but I complied and gave him my phone number. I was never contacted by him again and I received a notification later that said the parcel was delivered. I quickly checked this and sure enough it says parcel handed to customer. This was extremely weird since you need a one-time password to claim the package. This password is sent to you via email an hour before the delivery. This password is needed for the delivery driver to mark it as delivered. I quickly called customer service at 1.54 and the lady I was with called the delivery driver and the driver said that he still has the package. I was then informed that the parcel will arrive between the 18th and the 20th of July and that I shouldn't worry that the parcel is marked as delivered. On 20th of July I called customer service again to tell them that the package hasn't arrived and they told me that it arrived on the 18th at 12.30. I told them that that hadn't happened and that I also called them that day and that they told me to expect it by the 20th. I was told that there will be an investigation that will take 24-48 hours and then I'll be informed of what happened. At this point I didn't care much for the laptop. I just wanted my money back. On the 21st I called them again and they told me that they can't give me a refund or deliver the package since it already has been delivered at 12.30 of the 18th. This clearly didn't happen since I was told on the same day at 1.54 that the delivery driver still had the package. I tried texting customer support 3 more times and I was met with the same response. I screenshotted all the texts and my call log in case they are needed. I also screenshotted the emails from amazon and I decided to pursue this case to get my money or my laptop.

Looking back on it, it seems really obvious that I was scammed by the delivery driver when he asked my phone number and that he somehow accessed my email from that and got the one time password. I have decided to send a copy of the screenshots to the police and to email the head branch of Amazon in Seattle to say that I will be pressing charges.

I am posting this to ask for any more advice regarding this and to check if this scam has happened to any other people and to also warn people to not give any personal info to anyone without ensuring it.

I would also like to clarify that I live in the UK however I do not have the nationality.

Thank you all for reading this and please respond  as any help will be needed in this situation.

EDIT: There seems to be a big understanding about the number thing. The driver called me from an Amazon number and Amazon can't leak my number (due to privacy policy) to the driver so it is hidden. So he doesn't have access to my number  from any other phone. He can only call me from the Amazon device he has. To get my phone number he needed to ask me for it.
Edit 2: Multiple redditors have told me that drivers can use the last 3 digits of your phone number as the OTP. I now realise how he ""hacked"" into my email.

Amazon,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,Europe

Amazon,FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon,"FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.

The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors.
The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.

The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.

The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.

In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

i called amazon and they said that they cannot give me any answers for another 2 days. i also have a warning strike on my account for when a previous order was stolen after being delivered to a communal area in the flat (which is shared by hundreds of other residents) - this first time round, they said that numerous people had been claiming fraudulent refunded when items were in fact delivered. my ""strike"" had zero evidence of what they are accusing me of, and ultimately it was their fault.

i asked the phone handler if today's occurrence could have been a mistake from the driver accidentally marking it as delivered, or maybe doing it on purpose to hit their quota for the day without getting into trouble (amazon delivery drivers notoriously have tight targets in regards to timing).

she said this could possibly be the case. i asked her if this was legal. she refused to answer me when i continued to ask her this multiple times.

not sure what to do here. how can i at least ensure that i get the money back for this phone / what are my legal rights? can i take this to the police?",-0.9129,-0.9129,-0.9129,-0.9129,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/157o7t4/amazon_delivery_worth_almost_800_has_gone_missing/,07/24/2023,00:45:01,truth_over_fiction,150,Europe

This deal is 100% happening, almost certainly today during trading or right at market close today.

Edit: Editing my post now just to give a word of warning. I am a regard. I consistently lose money. I usually make a big play that goes well and then slowly lose those gains on smaller plays.
I am down 35% on my port as of yesterday due to a certain movie theater stock. So please do not put money you can’t afford to lose into this play.

**Edit 2: Never mind, I’m literally the next Warren Buffet, fuck you all, I was sooo right, you can suck the turds out my ass hole**

Amazon,Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them.,"Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them. I was scammed by Amazon and been denied a refund or my product and therefore I will be suing them.

On July 15th, I ordered my dream laptop off Amazon for a price north of 500£ and south of 1000£. The time of delivery was scheduled to be on the Tuesday 18th July and I was really excited to receive the laptop. However, I was called by the delivery driver at 12.34 and was told that he is in my area and that he would like my personal phone number to contact me after 10 minutes to deliver the parcel. I was a bit weirded out by this but I complied and gave him my phone number. I was never contacted by him again and I received a notification later that said the parcel was delivered. I quickly checked this and sure enough it says parcel handed to customer. This was extremely weird since you need a one-time password to claim the package. This password is sent to you via email an hour before the delivery. This password is needed for the delivery driver to mark it as delivered. I quickly called customer service at 1.54 and the lady I was with called the delivery driver and the driver said that he still has the package. I was then informed that the parcel will arrive between the 18th and the 20th of July and that I shouldn't worry that the parcel is marked as delivered. On 20th of July I called customer service again to tell them that the package hasn't arrived and they told me that it arrived on the 18th at 12.30. I told them that that hadn't happened and that I also called them that day and that they told me to expect it by the 20th. I was told that there will be an investigation that will take 24-48 hours and then I'll be informed of what happened. At this point I didn't care much for the laptop. I just wanted my money back. On the 21st I called them again and they told me that they can't give me a refund or deliver the package since it already has been delivered at 12.30 of the 18th. This clearly didn't happen since I was told on the same day at 1.54 that the delivery driver still had the package. I tried texting customer support 3 more times and I was met with the same response. I screenshotted all the texts and my call log in case they are needed. I also screenshotted the emails from amazon and I decided to pursue this case to get my money or my laptop.

Looking back on it, it seems really obvious that I was scammed by the delivery driver when he asked my phone number and that he somehow accessed my email from that and got the one time password. I have decided to send a copy of the screenshots to the police and to email the head branch of Amazon in Seattle to say that I will be pressing charges.

I am posting this to ask for any more advice regarding this and to check if this scam has happened to any other people and to also warn people to not give any personal info to anyone without ensuring it.

I would also like to clarify that I live in the UK however I do not have the nationality.

Thank you all for reading this and please respond  as any help will be needed in this situation.

EDIT: There seems to be a big understanding about the number thing. The driver called me from an Amazon number and Amazon can't leak my number (due to privacy policy) to the driver so it is hidden. So he doesn't have access to my number  from any other phone. He can only call me from the Amazon device he has. To get my phone number he needed to ask me for it.
Edit 2: Multiple redditors have told me that drivers can use the last 3 digits of your phone number as the OTP. I now realise how he ""hacked"" into my email.

Amazon,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,Africa

Amazon,FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon,"FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.

The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors.
The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.

The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.

The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.

In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

Amazon,amazon delivery worth almost £800 has gone missing,"amazon delivery worth almost £800 has gone missing ordered a new phone from amazon. £760. 

the item was out for delivery today. it was marked as delivered just before 7pm: ""handed to resident"". no photo of proof of delivery provided. i was given a code prior to delivery that i had to give to the courier. there is no record of it being delivered except a change on the system.

we also have amazon lockers so it should have been dropped off there had i not been in.

i called amazon and they said that they cannot give me any answers for another 2 days. i also have a warning strike on my account for when a previous order was stolen after being delivered to a communal area in the flat (which is shared by hundreds of other residents) - this first time round, they said that numerous people had been claiming fraudulent refunded when items were in fact delivered. my ""strike"" had zero evidence of what they are accusing me of, and ultimately it was their fault.

i asked the phone handler if today's occurrence could have been a mistake from the driver accidentally marking it as delivered, or maybe doing it on purpose to hit their quota for the day without getting into trouble (amazon delivery drivers notoriously have tight targets in regards to timing).

she said this could possibly be the case. i asked her if this was legal. she refused to answer me when i continued to ask her this multiple times.

not sure what to do here. how can i at least ensure that i get the money back for this phone / what are my legal rights? can i take this to the police?",-0.9129,-0.9129,-0.9129,-0.9129,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/157o7t4/amazon_delivery_worth_almost_800_has_gone_missing/,07/24/2023,00:45:01,truth_over_fiction,150,Africa

If you don’t believe me just search for it on amazon your self. 

This deal is 100% happening, almost certainly today during trading or right at market close today. 

Last chance to hop on the $8-$9 7/28 call train while options haven’t updated to reflect the news yet.



Edit: Editing my post now just to give a word of warning. I am a regard. I consistently lose money. I usually make a big play that goes well and then slowly lose those gains on smaller plays.
I am down 35% on my port as of yesterday due to a certain movie theater stock. So please do not put money you can’t afford to lose into this play.

**Edit 2: Never mind, I’m literally the next Warren Buffet, fuck you all, I was sooo right, you can suck the turds out my ass hole**

Edit 3: Jobs posting on Dish’s website specifically naming Amazon in the posting. This deal is 100% happening.

Amazon,Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them.,"Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them. I was scammed by Amazon and been denied a refund or my product and therefore I will be suing them.

On July 15th, I ordered my dream laptop off Amazon for a price north of 500£ and south of 1000£. The time of delivery was scheduled to be on the Tuesday 18th July and I was really excited to receive the laptop. However, I was called by the delivery driver at 12.34 and was told that he is in my area and that he would like my personal phone number to contact me after 10 minutes to deliver the parcel. I was a bit weirded out by this but I complied and gave him my phone number. I was never contacted by him again and I received a notification later that said the parcel was delivered. I quickly checked this and sure enough it says parcel handed to customer. This was extremely weird since you need a one-time password to claim the package. This password is sent to you via email an hour before the delivery. This password is needed for the delivery driver to mark it as delivered. I quickly called customer service at 1.54 and the lady I was with called the delivery driver and the driver said that he still has the package. I was then informed that the parcel will arrive between the 18th and the 20th of July and that I shouldn't worry that the parcel is marked as delivered. On 20th of July I called customer service again to tell them that the package hasn't arrived and they told me that it arrived on the 18th at 12.30. I told them that that hadn't happened and that I also called them that day and that they told me to expect it by the 20th. I was told that there will be an investigation that will take 24-48 hours and then I'll be informed of what happened. At this point I didn't care much for the laptop. I just wanted my money back. On the 21st I called them again and they told me that they can't give me a refund or deliver the package since it already has been delivered at 12.30 of the 18th. This clearly didn't happen since I was told on the same day at 1.54 that the delivery driver still had the package. I tried texting customer support 3 more times and I was met with the same response. I screenshotted all the texts and my call log in case they are needed. I also screenshotted the emails from amazon and I decided to pursue this case to get my money or my laptop.

Looking back on it, it seems really obvious that I was scammed by the delivery driver when he asked my phone number and that he somehow accessed my email from that and got the one time password. I have decided to send a copy of the screenshots to the police and to email the head branch of Amazon in Seattle to say that I will be pressing charges.

I am posting this to ask for any more advice regarding this and to check if this scam has happened to any other people and to also warn people to not give any personal info to anyone without ensuring it.

I would also like to clarify that I live in the UK however I do not have the nationality.

Thank you all for reading this and please respond  as any help will be needed in this situation.

EDIT: There seems to be a big understanding about the number thing. The driver called me from an Amazon number and Amazon can't leak my number (due to privacy policy) to the driver so it is hidden. So he doesn't have access to my number  from any other phone. He can only call me from the Amazon device he has. To get my phone number he needed to ask me for it.
Edit 2: Multiple redditors have told me that drivers can use the last 3 digits of your phone number as the OTP. I now realise how he ""hacked"" into my email.

Amazon,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,Asia
Amazon,Amazon trying to force resignations over return to work,"Amazon trying to force resignations over return to work There was a post on /r/cscareerquestions by someone who had this happen to them. This is worse than firing people. This is people hired in remote locations and not near a hub to work at. They want them to ""quit"" to deny unemployment insurance and the WARN act. do not quit if this happens to you. Send an email and CC lots of people stating you do not quit. Apparently they are doing the ""forced resignations"" verbally. I hope they get a class action suit over this. The only reason to call it quitting is to avoid WARN act and to avoid unemployment insurance. Its totally sleazy.

Amazon,FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon,"FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.

The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors.
The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.

The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.

The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.

In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

Amazon,amazon delivery worth almost £800 has gone missing,"amazon delivery worth almost £800 has gone missing ordered a new phone from amazon. £760. 

the item was out for delivery today. it was marked as delivered just before 7pm: ""handed to resident"". no photo of proof of delivery provided. i was given a code prior to delivery that i had to give to the courier. there is no record of it being delivered except a change on the system.

we also have amazon lockers so it should have been dropped off there had i not been in.

i called amazon and they said that they cannot give me any answers for another 2 days. i also have a warning strike on my account for when a previous order was stolen after being delivered to a communal area in the flat (which is shared by hundreds of other residents) - this first time round, they said that numerous people had been claiming fraudulent refunded when items were in fact delivered. my ""strike"" had zero evidence of what they are accusing me of, and ultimately it was their fault.

i asked the phone handler if today's occurrence could have been a mistake from the driver accidentally marking it as delivered, or maybe doing it on purpose to hit their quota for the day without getting into trouble (amazon delivery drivers notoriously have tight targets in regards to timing).

she said this could possibly be the case. i asked her if this was legal. she refused to answer me when i continued to ask her this multiple times.

not sure what to do here. how can i at least ensure that i get the money back for this phone / what are my legal rights? can i take this to the police?",-0.9129,-0.9129,-0.9129,-0.9129,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/157o7t4/amazon_delivery_worth_almost_800_has_gone_missing/,07/24/2023,00:45:01,truth_over_fiction,150,Asia

Amazon,Dish and Amazon deal 100% happening,"Dish and Amazon deal 100% happening Just searched “Boost Infinite Sim” on amazon, and it brings up an inbuilt ad for the leaked $25 a month plan, the ad links to a 404 page but it will probably go live once the announcement is made. If you don’t believe me just search for it on amazon your self. 

This deal is 100% happening, almost certainly today during trading or right at market close today. 

Last chance to hop on the $8-$9 7/28 call train while options haven’t updated to reflect the news yet.



Edit: Editing my post now just to give a word of warning. I am a regard. I consistently lose money. I usually make a big play that goes well and then slowly lose those gains on smaller plays.
I am down 35% on my port as of yesterday due to a certain movie theater stock. So please do not put money you can’t afford to lose into this play.

**Edit 2: Never mind, I’m literally the next Warren Buffet, fuck you all, I was sooo right, you can suck the turds out my ass hole**

Edit 3: Jobs posting on Dish’s website specifically naming Amazon in the posting. This deal is 100% happening.

Amazon,Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them.,"Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them. I was scammed by Amazon and been denied a refund or my product and therefore I will be suing them.

On July 15th, I ordered my dream laptop off Amazon for a price north of 500£ and south of 1000£. The time of delivery was scheduled to be on the Tuesday 18th July and I was really excited to receive the laptop. However, I was called by the delivery driver at 12.34 and was told that he is in my area and that he would like my personal phone number to contact me after 10 minutes to deliver the parcel. I was a bit weirded out by this but I complied and gave him my phone number. I was never contacted by him again and I received a notification later that said the parcel was delivered. I quickly checked this and sure enough it says parcel handed to customer. This was extremely weird since you need a one-time password to claim the package. This password is sent to you via email an hour before the delivery. This password is needed for the delivery driver to mark it as delivered. I quickly called customer service at 1.54 and the lady I was with called the delivery driver and the driver said that he still has the package. I was then informed that the parcel will arrive between the 18th and the 20th of July and that I shouldn't worry that the parcel is marked as delivered. On 20th of July I called customer service again to tell them that the package hasn't arrived and they told me that it arrived on the 18th at 12.30. I told them that that hadn't happened and that I also called them that day and that they told me to expect it by the 20th. I was told that there will be an investigation that will take 24-48 hours and then I'll be informed of what happened. At this point I didn't care much for the laptop. I just wanted my money back. On the 21st I called them again and they told me that they can't give me a refund or deliver the package since it already has been delivered at 12.30 of the 18th. This clearly didn't happen since I was told on the same day at 1.54 that the delivery driver still had the package. I tried texting customer support 3 more times and I was met with the same response. I screenshotted all the texts and my call log in case they are needed. I also screenshotted the emails from amazon and I decided to pursue this case to get my money or my laptop.

Looking back on it, it seems really obvious that I was scammed by the delivery driver when he asked my phone number and that he somehow accessed my email from that and got the one time password. I have decided to send a copy of the screenshots to the police and to email the head branch of Amazon in Seattle to say that I will be pressing charges.

I am posting this to ask for any more advice regarding this and to check if this scam has happened to any other people and to also warn people to not give any personal info to anyone without ensuring it.

I would also like to clarify that I live in the UK however I do not have the nationality.

Thank you all for reading this and please respond  as any help will be needed in this situation.

EDIT: There seems to be a big understanding about the number thing. The driver called me from an Amazon number and Amazon can't leak my number (due to privacy policy) to the driver so it is hidden. So he doesn't have access to my number  from any other phone. He can only call me from the Amazon device he has. To get my phone number he needed to ask me for it.
Edit 2: Multiple redditors have told me that drivers can use the last 3 digits of your phone number as the OTP. I now realise how he ""hacked"" into my email.

Amazon,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,Other

This is worse than firing people. This is people hired in remote locations and not near a hub to work at. They want them to ""quit"" to deny unemployment insurance and the WARN act. do not quit if this happens to you. Send an email and CC lots of people stating you do not quit. Apparently they are doing the ""forced resignations"" verbally. I hope they get a class action suit over this. The only reason to call it quitting is to avoid WARN act and to avoid unemployment insurance. Its totally sleazy.

Amazon,FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon,"FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.

The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors.
The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.

The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.

The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.

In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

we also have amazon lockers so it should have been dropped off there had i not been in.

i called amazon and they said that they cannot give me any answers for another 2 days. i also have a warning strike on my account for when a previous order was stolen after being delivered to a communal area in the flat (which is shared by hundreds of other residents) - this first time round, they said that numerous people had been claiming fraudulent refunded when items were in fact delivered. my ""strike"" had zero evidence of what they are accusing me of, and ultimately it was their fault.

i asked the phone handler if today's occurrence could have been a mistake from the driver accidentally marking it as delivered, or maybe doing it on purpose to hit their quota for the day without getting into trouble (amazon delivery drivers notoriously have tight targets in regards to timing).

she said this could possibly be the case. i asked her if this was legal. she refused to answer me when i continued to ask her this multiple times.

And everytime I do I specifically check German questions and I always see someone ask something like ""Does this item come with a charger"" and then several people replying with ""I don't know"" or ""I have not received the item"".

It partially annoys me but mostly confuses me why so many Germans reply to questions they don't have a helpful answer to. Their replies are literally pointless.

Each locker room will be built to accommodate the demand of that neighborhood, and routes and the way bags are arranged will be improved for efficiency to adapt to this new system.

This deal is 100% happening, almost certainly today during trading or right at market close today. 

Last chance to hop on the $8-$9 7/28 call train while options haven’t updated to reflect the news yet.



Edit: Editing my post now just to give a word of warning. I am a regard. I consistently lose money. I usually make a big play that goes well and then slowly lose those gains on smaller plays.
I am down 35% on my port as of yesterday due to a certain movie theater stock. So please do not put money you can’t afford to lose into this play.

**Edit 2: Never mind, I’m literally the next Warren Buffet, fuck you all, I was sooo right, you can suck the turds out my ass hole**

Edit 3: Jobs posting on Dish’s website specifically naming Amazon in the posting. This deal is 100% happening.

Amazon,Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them.,"Amazon scammed me and I will be suing them. I was scammed by Amazon and been denied a refund or my product and therefore I will be suing them.

On July 15th, I ordered my dream laptop off Amazon for a price north of 500£ and south of 1000£. The time of delivery was scheduled to be on the Tuesday 18th July and I was really excited to receive the laptop. However, I was called by the delivery driver at 12.34 and was told that he is in my area and that he would like my personal phone number to contact me after 10 minutes to deliver the parcel. I was a bit weirded out by this but I complied and gave him my phone number. I was never contacted by him again and I received a notification later that said the parcel was delivered. I quickly checked this and sure enough it says parcel handed to customer. This was extremely weird since you need a one-time password to claim the package. This password is sent to you via email an hour before the delivery. This password is needed for the delivery driver to mark it as delivered. I quickly called customer service at 1.54 and the lady I was with called the delivery driver and the driver said that he still has the package. I was then informed that the parcel will arrive between the 18th and the 20th of July and that I shouldn't worry that the parcel is marked as delivered. On 20th of July I called customer service again to tell them that the package hasn't arrived and they told me that it arrived on the 18th at 12.30. I told them that that hadn't happened and that I also called them that day and that they told me to expect it by the 20th. I was told that there will be an investigation that will take 24-48 hours and then I'll be informed of what happened. At this point I didn't care much for the laptop. I just wanted my money back. On the 21st I called them again and they told me that they can't give me a refund or deliver the package since it already has been delivered at 12.30 of the 18th. This clearly didn't happen since I was told on the same day at 1.54 that the delivery driver still had the package. I tried texting customer support 3 more times and I was met with the same response. I screenshotted all the texts and my call log in case they are needed. I also screenshotted the emails from amazon and I decided to pursue this case to get my money or my laptop.

Looking back on it, it seems really obvious that I was scammed by the delivery driver when he asked my phone number and that he somehow accessed my email from that and got the one time password. I have decided to send a copy of the screenshots to the police and to email the head branch of Amazon in Seattle to say that I will be pressing charges.

I am posting this to ask for any more advice regarding this and to check if this scam has happened to any other people and to also warn people to not give any personal info to anyone without ensuring it.

I would also like to clarify that I live in the UK however I do not have the nationality.

Thank you all for reading this and please respond  as any help will be needed in this situation.

EDIT: There seems to be a big understanding about the number thing. The driver called me from an Amazon number and Amazon can't leak my number (due to privacy policy) to the driver so it is hidden. So he doesn't have access to my number  from any other phone. He can only call me from the Amazon device he has. To get my phone number he needed to ask me for it.
Edit 2: Multiple redditors have told me that drivers can use the last 3 digits of your phone number as the OTP. I now realise how he ""hacked"" into my email.

Amazon,Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.,"Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices. A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished ""excellent quality"" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their ""guarantee"" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.

Even before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially ""buying me off"", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was ""simply readjusting to the proper reading"" and to ""not worry about it"". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because ""hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?"". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the ""green screen of death"" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.

TL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and ""bought me off"" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.

This may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.

Edit:  
YES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is ""my fault"" because of ""damage to the retina display"". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest. They are trying to bullshit me into thinking the phone magically broke from my own doing.",-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,-0.9859,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152gcbv/do_not_buy_amazon_renewed_apple_devices/,07/18/2023,03:36:11,TimTim3610,333,

Amazon,FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon,"FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.

The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors.
The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.

The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.

The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.

In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

we also have amazon lockers so it should have been dropped off there had i not been in.

i asked the phone handler if today's occurrence could have been a mistake from the driver accidentally marking it as delivered, or maybe doing it on purpose to hit their quota for the day without getting into trouble (amazon delivery drivers notoriously have tight targets in regards to timing).

she said this could possibly be the case. i asked her if this was legal. she refused to answer me when i continued to ask her this multiple times.

JP Morgan,JP Morgan Chase earnings report,"JP Morgan Chase earnings report The 2023 Q2 earnings report for JPMorgan Chase has just been released. Overall, the ER is a remarkable demonstration of the durability and power of the top bank. JPM's results, both top and bottom line, exceeded market forecasts. The fact that the bank declared a solid balance sheet during and after a highly tumultuous time for the banking industry is, in my opinion, more significant.   
The last one or two quarters have been described by certain media as the most difficult for banks since the 2008 crisis. JPM was able to keep a healthy standardised CET1 capital ratio of 13.8% even after the First Republic deal. J.P. Morgan was able to negotiate a favourable price because they were the only reliable buyer for FRC. In a back-of-the-envelope analysis of the transaction, Matt Levine of Bloomberg noted how J.P. Morgan receives good upside and regulatory protection while sharing a large portion of the potential losses if the loans default. Although the estimated $500 million in annual net income for the agreement is small in comparison to the $40 billion or so they already generate, it demonstrates that a bank like JPMorgan can take advantage of the crisis.  
The bank currently has $1.4 trillion in cash and short-term securities, which is a lot of liquidity. I have no doubt that JPM will be able to fulfil these new standards and keep its fortress balance sheet, even though there may be some capital changes and liquidity in the near future as the banking industry adapts to new rules.  
Given the current instability in the banking industry, regulatory standards may be modified in various ways. With Basel III's completion, Dimon himself anticipates ""material changes"" to capital and liquidity.

JP Morgan,Registered silver continues to drain with another truckload out of registered at Brinks. JP Morgan's gold vault sees 5 tonne hasta la vaulta. That is 3% of their vault total.,"Registered silver continues to drain with another truckload out of registered at Brinks. JP Morgan's gold vault sees 5 tonne hasta la vaulta. That is 3% of their vault total. &#x200B;

Following up from last week's analysis, the July contract continues adding net new contracts for immediate delivery. Friday saw 32 move contracts tacked on or 160,000 koz. The cumulative after 5 days is 402 contracts or 2.01 million oz or 5.8% of registered silver.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syii3vhe17bb1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd535a20564b936aed1d04018e6614108bf1eb1

At the silver vaults one even truckload was removed from Brinks' vault. That is 3 days in a row where one even truckload was moved out of registered. I'd surmise that this party is whoever bought part of the 12 million oz sold by Standard Chartered (and delivered out of Brinks' vault). Only 3 parties were issued more than 1.8 million oz that day ...

&#x200B;

* JP Morgan customer accounts -    6.070 million oz
* BofA                                                   2.565 million oz
* Morgan Stanley house account - 2.225 million oz.

Time may tell, or at least indicate, who is moving metal out of registered. It all 12 million oz moves out, that'd be 17 more truckloads.  And, for the record, I'm not predicting that.

&#x200B;

I thought it was odd that silver was moving out of registered in 600 koz batches even thought it hasn't (yet) moved out of the vault. I've documented that silver moves in or out of the vault in 600 koz tranches, but moves from registered to eligible or versa vice could be different.

I don't know if vaults segregate registered from eligible. If it was just a digital reassignment, you'd think they could change status of any amount of silver with just a click the mouse. If they actually move the metal, there could be size considerations to change status.

Curiosity got the best of me and I did the stats. Moves in and out of registered ARE more frequent than most other size moves except small moves (-250,000 to +50,000).  See the histogram below.

And those are thousands of oz on the x-axis:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7cctiwwh67bb1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d58f74518c3bbdb4fbf4f17158bc07e26f69cb5

But if you consider the percentage of total oz moved, the truckload size change jumps out:

https://preview.redd.it/sc55raxna7bb1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd21a233c2f840bda40cd4f36d7bd5a552f571e

It's possible that there are moves into or out of registered in 600 koz lots only because it arrives or departs the vaults in those sizes. I'm saying that because often silver moves in or out of the vault occur before or soon after the change from registered. To get to the bottom of that, I'd have to strip out moves that weren't associated with a move in or out of the vault. Ain't doing that right now. Maybe someday.

At the end of all that ... I don't know why these 3 Brinks' moves have been 3 sequential 600 koz changes and the metal remains in eligible.

MTB also moved 100 koz out of registered:

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold Vaults

JP Morgan's vault sees 5 even tonne (160 koz) moved out of the vault. That is 3.1% of that vaults total silver. Depository Services of Delaware also sees 12 koz depart.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ckuiqiqjd7bb1.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=33c4e5a7b7b87b223605261a187caaf2e4bd6cfe

The JP Morgan withdrawal isn't connected to any recent moves from registered. The last move exceeding 5 tonne from JP Morgan's registered was May 23, or 34 biz days ago.

Perhaps their recent gold vault build will be reversed:

JP Morgan,"JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz.","JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz. The total of JP Morgan's vault of registered silver has dwindled from over 40 million oz at the start of the silver squeeze to 8.1 million oz.

The JP Morgan vault would be the total of JP Morgan, the bank's silver, and customer silver. Typically JP Morgan's house account doesn't keep much silver in registered so this move out today is likely silver owned by customer accounts.

A couple of weeks ago I had written that I identified BofA as removing vast quantities of gold, 25.9 tonne, from registered at JP Morgan's vault.  This could be BofA's silver.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another\_75\_tonne\_of\_gold\_moved\_out\_of\_jp\_morgans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another_75_tonne_of_gold_moved_out_of_jp_morgans/)

&#x200B;

JP Morgan's eligible metal stands at 133.3 million oz. From that, deduct the 103 million oz that is ""owned"" by SLV's authorized participants (and probably a few other parties) which leaves 30.3 million oz. Again, that would be the total of customer and the bank's silver.

I had documented the occasions where it became apparent that the JP Morgan, the bank, was out of silver during 2022 although they have likely restocked to some extent. I always pay special attention to JP Morgan as they are the cabal's lead banker.

Today's comex total of 27.3 million oz is a 6.5 year low last seen in December 29, 2016.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold Vaults

There was a large move out of the gold vaults at JP Morgan's vaults, 221 koz or 6.86 tonne. That's 2.5% of JP Morgan's vault total and 1% of comex total.

A couple of weeks ago I documented huge moves at JP Morgan's gold vault as metal  moved out of registered. Now it appears that it is going out of the vault.

On May 23 and 24 there were 589 koz or 18.3 tonne moved out of registered. I posted an analysis that showed that the likely perp was almost certainly BofA. They are the only party that has net stopped that much gold, specifically 30.5 tonne since March 30 of this year and 124 tonne over the last 2-1/2 years.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147\_tonne\_vacates\_jp\_morgans\_comex\_gold\_vault/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147_tonne_vacates_jp_morgans_comex_gold_vault/)

Since those moves out of registered, JP Morgan's gold vault has been fairly quiet. It isn't a certainty that this is BofA's gold that was 1) recently bought at comex and 2) moved out of registered and 3) now moved out of the vault. But it is likely. 

If it is BofA's gold, this 6.86 tonne would represent 38% of the that 18.3 tonne moved out of registered on May 23 and 23. We may get some clarity in the days ahead if there is a follow up move(s) out of the vault.

Why care? BofA has been a huge buyer of gold at comex over the last 2-1/2 years. They have bought a net 4.0 million oz (124 tonne). IF (notice that is in uppercase), all of that was in JP Morgan's vault, that would represent 80% of the JP Morgan vault total. Yesterday's move of 6.86 tonne is only 6% of BofA's net stopped gold. How's that for an avalanche waiting to fall?

The numbers to the oz:

A truckload (640 koz) was deposited at Loomis' vault and a half truckload departed Brinks for a net increase of 361 koz:

No change in registered, and even with 6 continuous days of no change in registered. That is no big deal.

I hear that yesterday one of my (blocked) trolls on Twitter is making a deal about there being 5 days of no change in registered silver. BFD. In fact, it is the 4th time **this year** that has occurred.  Even after yesterday's 6th day in a row of no change, a continuous 6 day span has happened **3 times this year**.

It's still about 10 days too early to look at the countdown to first notice on the July silver contract, however I can't help but notice that the OI decline is less than average:

&#x200B;

This next plot is the daily change in OI ... essentially the derivative of the plot above. Note that the daily decline is running a couple of thousand contracts per day below average.

Meanwhile traders are flooding into the September contract causing a surge in total OI. See the plot below.

Note the blue line for the May 23 contract also experienced an OI surge at this point in the cycle. I'll have to think about why they are mirroring each other.

Yesterday the OI increase for the September contract (7,296) was more than double the decline for July (3,167). Usually, during the core of the roll, these are offsetting. The total OI increase is 4,382.

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    comex vaults

Yesterday was ""take it away Tuesday"" at the comex vaults. One truckload (600 koz) departed JP Morgan and Loomis' vaults, 476 koz was out of Delaware Depository and 100 koz was out of CNT. All of that was somewhat offset by a 487 koz deposit at JP Morgan and 300 koz at Brinks.

The net change was 978 koz OUT OF THE VAULT:

https://preview.redd.it/ht16uy1nh16b1.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=a01f6d1361ea8579346c19f2e7841b9f18279476

&#x200B;

But that was nothing compared to gold.  Brinks' gold vault saw a 162 koz or 5.0 tonne departure. That is 3.4% of Brinks' vault total.

Scrolling back in time, Brinks had a 367 koz move out of registered on May 30, just a couple of weeks ago. That date was first notice day on the June contract so I have to try to pair that move with a gold buyer. However, nobody stopped that much gold, so I can't point the finger at anyone specifically. The largest buyer(s) that day were JP Morgan customer accounts at 353 koz ... fairly close. It is possible the vault move was JP Morgan customer account gold.

Here was the detail from that day:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely\_odd\_day\_for\_comex\_silver\_all\_just\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely_odd_day_for_comex_silver_all_just_to/)

Here we are 10 biz days later and 162 koz moves out of the vault. It's logical to connect those, although that is not certain. Perhaps that 5 tonne will show up at JP Morgan's vault or perhaps another large comex player is buying gold at comex, moving it out of registered and then OUT OF THE VAULT.

Asahi, the new vault, showed a 48 koz deposit.

JP Morgan,"Did JP Morgan Chase just get a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout to make it a bigger systemic risk so that the global financial system must bail them out?","Did JP Morgan Chase just get a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout to make it a bigger systemic risk so that the global financial system must bail them out? According to the list of global systemically important banks ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_systemically_important_banks), [Financial Stability Board (FSB)](https://www.fsb.org/2022/11/2022-list-of-global-systemically-important-banks-g-sibs/), [FSB PDF](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P211122.pdf)), JP Morgan Chase is top dog as the *only Tier 4* bank.  (The higher the tier, the more systemic risk the bank poses to the financial system so the required capital buffer is higher at each tier.)

>A systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis). They are colloquially referred to as ""[**too big to fail**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail)"". \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution)\]

According to the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements), which has a [dashboard](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/) showing scores and components for Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs), JP Morgan Chase is by itself in Tier 4 with the highest overall risk rating as the most interconnected bank with the most complex banking relationships.

[Global systemically important banks: assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement \(Nov 2022\)](https://preview.redd.it/tptv8xjx39xa1.png?width=1109&format=png&auto=webp&s=a427e29b63440f39891c6b714e224dd88fe39e25)

***If*** **JP Morgan Chase were to fail, the financial system would be at high risk of a financial crisis.**  *Which means JPM Chase is in an interesting position because the global financial system is both incentivized to keep JPM from failing and, if an institution is to fail, putting the most complex and interconnected financial institution at risk* ***maximizes the likelihood of another bailout***.

Some of you may remember from 2 years ago (April 15, 2021) that JP Morgan sold $13B in bonds in the largest bank deal ever at the time ([SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt6bju/why_banks_randomly_decided_to_sell_billions_in/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/jpmorgan-to-sell-13-billion-of-bonds-in-largest-bank-sale-ever)) to raise money.  The next day, Bank of America takes the lead by selling $15B worth of bonds ([SuperStonk DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsioql/the_complete_bank_of_america_gamestop_dd/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/bofa-to-set-record-for-largest-bank-bond-sale-at-15-billion#xj4y7vzkg), April 16, 2021).

So if JP Morgan needed to raise some serious money *without getting a bailout*, buying another bank in a sweetheart deal seems like another way to juice up JP Morgan's balance sheet with some good PR. According to [CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/01/business/first-republic-purchase-hnk-intl/index.html),

>First Republic ... had assets of **$229.1 billion** as of April 13. As of the end of last year, it was the nation’s **14th-largest bank**, according to a ranking by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States with total global assets of **nearly $4 trillion** as of March 31.

Now that JP Morgan picked up First Republic, their total assets increases by about $229B (about 5.7%).  And, according to Reuters \[[Factbox](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-deal-collapsed-first-republic-explained-2023-05-01/)\], JP Morgan just got a pretty sweet deal with First Republic Bank:

* JPMorgan Chase will pay **$10.6 billion** to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC)
* Will **not** assume First Republic's corporate **debt** or preferred stock
* FDIC to provide [loss share agreements](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/) with respect to most acquired loans

So JP Morgan paid $10.6B to pick up $229B (less than 5c on the dollar), passes on the corporate debt, and shares losses with the FDIC so that:

* JPMorgan expects one-time gain of **$2.6 billion** post-tax at closing
* Estimated to add roughly **$500 million to net income** and be accretive to tangible book value per share

**That's a pretty damn good deal.**  Let's look more into what the FDIC says about [shared loss agreements (SLA)](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/jqe3z9ira9xa1.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=cefb80e4cb215985e0ac3c5836fe1c77316b7b7e)

The FDIC absorbs a portion of the loss on assets sold through resolving a failed bank ""sharing the loss with the purchaser of the failed bank"".  *Sounds like the FDIC just took one for the team.*

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/7qob3s6qb9xa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bfd02469344d43cef0f50540691e63c9c08b22a)

According to the FDIC, loss sharing is basically an 80/20 split (except for after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis when the split was 95/5, which has ended).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/alkxtvz6c9xa1.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d900e614b00abc103fb360936f421a708a047e2)

According to the FDIC, resolving a failed bank with loss sharing is supposed to be based on **the least costly option** (to the Deposit Insurance Fund).  (We've seen this least costly option come up in resolving bank failures before with the FDIC and Federal Reserve contemplating requiring Too Big To Fail banks sell destined-to-fail bonds to absorb losses and reduce payouts by the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund \[[SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/zdebh6/comment_against_the_federal_reserve_fdic_proposal/)\])

According to [Investopedia, JPMorgan To Pay FDIC $10.6 Billion For First Republic, This is What It Gets](https://www.investopedia.com/what-does-jpmorgan-get-in-first-republic-deal-7487296), resolving FRC bank failure will cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $13B.

>The FDIC will take a **$13 billion hit to its fund** and *provide $50 billion in financing*.

Wait, the **FDIC is providing $50B to finance JPM buying FRC?!**

https://preview.redd.it/4j4du9umk9xa1.png?width=3492&format=png&auto=webp&s=33069c143c5351f6b2e616e6c826fc543090e181

The FDIC loaned JP Morgan $50B to buy the failed First Republic bank for $10.6B.  $30B of that was used to repay a [rescue deal from March (last month)](https://www.investopedia.com/first-republic-s-usd30b-rescue-by-jp-morgan-citi-and-bank-of-america-7367932) backed by JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.  Which means JP Morgan gets their money back from the previous rescue *plus* an **extra $9.4B** out of this loan deal to buy $229B worth of assets from First Republic.

On top of that, JP Morgan splits losses with the FDIC 80/20 with the FDIC covering 80% of loan losses for the next 5-7 years (5 years for commercial loans and 7 years for residential mortgages).

**Imagine if a bank** ***loans you*** **$9,400 to buy a $229,000 house.**  No down payment.  Just ""here's $9,400 and the keys to that $229,000 house"". Oh, and the bank will cover 80% of the cost for anything that breaks in the house for the next 5-7 years.  *This is an insane deal.*

**Which truly makes one wonder if this is a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout for JP Morgan,** the *only* Tier 4 GSIB as the most interconnected bank with the most complex banking relationships and the highest overall systemic risk rating.

Are we going to see:

1. Fat bonuses at JP Morgan?
2. Followed by news about JP Morgan posing a systemic risk?
3. Followed by calls to bail out JP Morgan to save pensions?

This is exactly why anonymity and privacy is so important in crypto as a future of finance and potential TradFi and banking replacement/improvement, as well as the significance of decentralization","19 States accused JP Morgan on closing accounts on religious or political beliefs. This is exactly why anonymity and privacy is so important in crypto as a future of finance and potential TradFi and banking replacement/improvement, as well as the significance of decentralization 19 states have come out accusing JP Morgan of of closing accounts and discriminating against customers due to their political or religious beliefs. A letter to JP Morgan said ""the bank had canceled major organizations' checking accounts and  had asked screening questions focused on religion and politics before  reinstating them"" JPMorgan also allegedly declined a proposal on participation in a  survey for the Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index, which is meant to determine ""freedom of expression and freedom of religion or  belief as a standard part of doing business,"". JPMorgan had received a score of 15% for the index in 2022 which obviously shows their massive bias and give credibility to the claims.

It's significant enough that JP Morgan would randomly close accounts, and defenders would have said it's due to anti-money laundering politcies/bank secrecy act etc, absolutely ridiculous and makes their intentions clear when they ask questions that screen customers religious and political beliefs before customers have just a *chance* to get their accounts reinstated.

There's been a bit of a push and pull in crypto whereby some people disagree with the need to anonymity. I'd argue that these are privileged people who've had no issues with banks having their information, but they only had no issues because they had money, which the bank wanted. The government view of crypto regulation is definitely to peel back that anonymity as far back as they can. But this situation shows exaclly why anonymity is important, as it immediately solves problems of discrimination as well as safety of the individuals as well so as not to become target, either of societal or corporate discrimination, or criminals.

And crypto balances it very well with allowing *privacy* but not *confidentiality*. Privacy means a lack of direct intrusion into private or personal affairs, so an anonymous blockchain has privacy, but not confidentiality.  This as confidentiality deals more with a complete block of access to information like the government sealing documents and offering no access at all.

It also ties right back into decentralization, where no centralized entity has the power to deny access to services on the blockchain. We all know that power corrupts and JP Morgan has way too much of that. Instead we have a decentralized blockchain where it would take a (mostly) democratic process to deny access to services, and even then it's pretty rare.

Plus JP Morgan adds another truckload for the 5th day in a row. The upcoming inactive June silver contract's open interest continues to drift upwards despite the chaos on the gold contracts. It now stands at 1,120 contracts. Typically nearly all of the OI of these inactive month contracts stand for delivery. First notice day is in 7 days.

https://preview.redd.it/i2jsvm8o9u0b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=416b79e3fb992185b1478ed0ef595be4ed71ffb3

I've rarely mentioned the micro silver contract. The ticker is SIL and it is a 1,000 oz deliverable contract. A guy on twitter, [@EsScalping](https://twitter.com/EsScalping), pointed out that there is also an ""E-mini"" silver contract. That ticker is QI and is for 2,500 oz but is only financially settled. You can't get silver on QI so it'll never impact comex vault totals.

Back to the SIL 1,000 oz micro contract. I mentioned yesterday that what's been happening is the CME group is making a market in the SIL contract.

Essentially there are three fairly big buyers and no sellers. The CME folks buy metal on the 5,000 oz SI contract and sell it to those 3 players on the 1,000 oz SIL contract.

I should probably say, I'm referring to the physical market ... those that stand for delivery. There may be others trading paper contracts, but I can't identify them.  I'm addressing the names I see on the issues and stops report for physical metal.

The CME group has sold 21.44 million oz net since 2019 and those three customer accounts have bought 21.42 million oz. The cumulative net tally for each is as follows:

There's been a few bubbas that have occasionally stopped contracts, but you can see it is round off.

When the CME folks buy metal at the SI contract, it is essentially like some combination of these 3 customer accounts buying it. The metal just passes through, usually the same day.

Below are plots of the issues, stops and net for 1) the CME group, and 2) the largest buyer, Advantage customer accounts. Note that Advantage has rarely sold any silver.

I've considered adding the two contracts (SI and SIL) together for my graphics. The only reason I haven't is that the reader will have a difficult time tracking the raw numbers from the report to the graphs. Personally, I like to do that when viewing plots to gain confidence in the data. For now, I haven't added them. Currently, some of the larger issues and stops from the SIL contract are greater than the smaller, inactive months, on the SI contract. So I may start adding them for plots in the future.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold

The gold open interest fell another 11,345 contracts and has now given back much of the OI surge that occurred 2 weeks ago:

The June active month is 7 days to first notice and has now fallen below the average:

Over lunch today I listened to a podcast that mentioned an increase in gold EFP (exchange for physical) volume. EFP's are a swap of a comex futures contract with a ""physical"" contract in London. Settlement by EFP rarely induces metal leaving London vaults.

As far as an EFP surge, I'm not seeing it. I track the cumulative EFP volume after zeroing the meter at day 44 (the start of the OI plateau). See the plot below. The June gold contract was riding the average line (the bold black line ) until recently and then drifted slightly below trend.

That said, the number of contracts that routinely vacate comex by EFP is huge. Usually it exceeds the total gold in registered as you can see below. The current registered gold is shown as the horizontal green line.

Another truckload arrived at JP Morgan's vault. That's a truckload in each of the last 5 days at JP Morgan's vault.

Yesterday I forgot to mention that the new vault operated by Asahi Depository, showed 1.2 million oz moved to registered and that is added to the comex vault registered total.

The day prior's statement for Asahi had all zeros. It was odd that their account statement didn't show metal being present the day before or being ""received"" on yesterday's report.  It just showed the ""adjustment"", which is the move to registered. Typically a move to registered has a deduct from eligible. Essentially, it just magically arrived.

Magic accounting. I wonder what's actually in Asahi's vault?

JP Morgan,📰 History Repeating – Jp Morgan & Rothschilds Redux,"📰 History Repeating – Jp Morgan & Rothschilds Redux **HISTORY REPEATING – JP MORGAN & ROTHSCHILDS REDUX** 

Little bit of a history of the gold/silver standard and what amounted to the Panic of 1896.  What’s interesting in this history lesson are the players and what they were trying to achieve – Rothschild and JP Morgan.  130 years later the same lessons are being told but the main players have not changed and the ultimate gain is banking as opposed to railway. 

JP Morgans undocumented manipulation of the gold and silver market has long been a speculated rumour and somewhat difficult thing to prove. So today we thought we’d take you on a journey back to 1895 – where speculation and government collusion were in fact tools used by JP Morgan and Rothschilds to both save the US from economic collapse and line their own pockets.  The result was the strengthening of these financial institutions, which over the years have used the same playbook to further enhance their market dominance and back-handed deals rewarding and not punishing their financial prowess.

The playbook? Wait for the government to fall into a panic or a financial crisis. Save the day. Manipulate markets to your advantage, and walk away with monopolistic powers.  In 1914 JP Morgan emerged as the major player and owner of railways in the US.  2023 JP Morgan emerges as the major player in US banking.  Both a mechanism of trade control – 1914 Industrial revolution trade control and 2023 banking and finance trade control.

**What’s a Panic?**

Rather than googling financial crisis – google panic, Pre-1900 the panic terminology appears to apply to any bubble or distorted market leading to market manipulation and panic, otherwise now known as a financial crisis.  Some examples include:

**Panic of 1819**

This was the first US widespread panic, driven by the end of the Napoleonic wars, it was compounded by asset bubbles in speculation in public lands – fueled by the unrestrained issue of ‘paper money’

**Panic of 1837**

Another panic set off from a real estate bubble and erratic American banking policy. Deflation set in with profit, prices and wages dropping.

**Panic of 1873**

This panic started in Europe with a stock market crash leading to investors liquidating bonds, in particular railway bonds in the US due to overdevelopment and speculation in railway.

**The Panic of 1893 and 1896**

Triggered by factors such as a failed coup in Argentina, a run on gold in the U.S. Treasury, and an oversupply of silver.

You see the gist here – gets a little 1800 repetitive and it was no wonder property prices remained fairly subdued throughout the 19th Century. It appears in the 20th Century, those Panic lessons may have been well and truly forgotten and the same old real estate lax banking bubbles emerged.

But for this history lesson we will focus on 1873 and 1893, and the great fortune JP Morgan was able to accumulate during this time and the role of gold and bonds that saw JP Morgan emerge as the US’s most powerful financial and railroad tycoon.

**Railroad Playbook**

JP Morgan cofounded Drexel, Morgan and company in 1871, becoming JP Morgan and company in 1895.  What seemed like a bad time to be in business turned out to be fortuitous to JP Morgan.  The Panic of 1873 started with the rampant inflation driven from overspeculation in railroads and the demonetization of silver in Germany and the US.  Following the American Civil War, 33,000 miles of railroad were built between 1868 and 1873.  Within the railroad craze a large infusion of cash was raised via bonds.  In 1871 Germany demonetized silver leading to an oversupply of silver, particularly in the US who mined most of the supply.  In 1873 the US passed the Coinage Act of 1873 backing the US dollar to a de facto gold standard.   This immediately depressed silver prices further, reduced money supply and raised interest rates hurting farmers.  People then shied away from long term bonds and collapsed the railway bond market.

In 1873 the precipice of the Panic happened when Jay Cooke and Company couldn’t sell millions of dollars of Northern Pacific Railway Bonds leading to its bankruptcy. By 1874 60 railroads had gone bankrupt 

In 1875 Congress backed the USD with gold helping to curb and stabilize the dollar.

It was 10 years after the collapse in railway bonds that JP Morgan emerged as a railway force, this time reorganizing railways, merging them and taking stakes, such as in 1885 when he arranged a merger between New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad.  

**Morgan-Belmont Syndicate**

Following the 1893 Panic, paper money was being exchanged for gold from treasury, draining the US Treasury of gold.  The hot money movement as it was later known had all the hallmarks of a self compelling bank run on Treasury due to a distrust of the US government’s gold reserve.  There was a rapid decline in gold reserves from $121,0000,000 on January 1st 1893 to $66,000,000 on February 1st 1894.  Under these circumstances the government used 4 subscriptions of $50,000,000 of 5% 10 year bonds over a 1894-1895.  But each time treasury again saw gold continue to pour out of treasury.  Speculative international transactions prompted by the fear of the ceasing of the gold standard saw another net outflow of $84,000,000 between October 1894 and January 1895, investors were liquidating bank balances and railroad bonds for gold and sending this gold to Europe at an increasing rate.

To assist with the US predicament a famous meeting between President Cleveland and JP Morgan in 1895 produced a syndicate and its contract on February 8th 1895.  The contract failed to name syndicate members with a veil of secrecy, although it is now known the syndicate included both Rothschilds and JP Morgan to name some of the more notable firms.  The contract was for the syndicate to bolster gold stock and stop outflows. The syndicate agreed to purchase 3,500,000 ounces of gold and sell it to the government with 4% 30 year bonds.  

The syndicate acquired $62,315,400 in government bonds at a 4% return, which they sold at 3 ¾% almost immediately for $68,833,591 – a tidy $5,000,000 immediate profit. Additional to the gold they delivered, within a week the syndicate saw other gold inflows of $10,000,000 from domestic holders.

The second condition was the syndicate exert control on the market (manipulate) to stop gold outflows.  The syndicate contract lasted 6 months, with the Syndicate manipulating control over the exchange rate to ensure enhanced profits from the arrangements

*‘The unique and imprecise manner by which authority was delegated by the government to a private syndicate to control the foreign-exchange market would be unthinkable in modern time’*

During this time it was also identified that the syndicate used moral suasion (more manipulation) to ensure other gold holders/investors did not withdraw further gold.  They appealed to these investors by giving bonds at preferential terms they would adhere to the ‘ship no gold’ agreement. Articles at the time supported the Syndicate and the moral suasion such as the United States Investor revered the Syndicate for stopping the previous deflation 

‘*To those persons to criticize the bond syndicate for keeping the price of the exchange at such high figures, it is sufficient to say that had the Syndicate not intervened, the cost of paying debts cold be even greater than at present, because gold would be in transit instead of exchange.’*

The Syndicate succeeded in reinvigorating faith in the US government and dollar and saw a period of prosperity follow, but it seems from this point the US Government owed the architects of the syndicate a favour.   And it appears during this time the Syndicate learnt the economic benefits of precious metal manipulation.

The end of the agreement saw Europe liquidate some of these railway bonds, which we’re sure became the icing on JP Morgans Railway cake as he emerged in 1902 as the largest US railway owner, controlling 5,000 miles of US railroads.

**JP Morgan and First Republic Bank today**

We all know this more recent story of JP Morgans takeover of multiple banks – Bear Sterns, First Republic Bank with the government again leaning on the financial Behemoth to help save the US dollar.  But just like in 1895 the favors and profits to be made are enhancing both the strength and influence of JP Morgan. 

During the First Republic deal laws were broken and profits were made, putting JP Morgan in a stronger monopolistic position in US banking, just like the railways in 1902.

The US law that needed to be circumvented, as JPMorgan ‘*is so big that by* **law it would not be allowed to buy First Republic** *because no one bank can have more than a 10 per cent market’*

And the profit made by JP Morgan: *‘Recognize an upfront, one-time, post-tax gain of approximately $2.6 billion, which does not reflect the approximately $2.0 billion dollars of post-tax restructuring costs anticipated over the next 18 months’*

History Repeats.

**Finally just a little bit of 2023/1873 comparison**

* 1998 tech boom leading to the 2000 collapse- with overinvestment and hype in a new technology – railway vs internet (Panic of 1873)
* 2008 Financial Crisis and deflation (Panic of 1895)
* And finally 2022 inflation, 14 years after the GFC, bought on by Covid, compared  the 1917  during and proceeding World War 1. With inflation in 1920 hitting 25% and 1921 a sharp reversal -15% so will we see a similar pattern in 2024/2025?

JP Morgan,14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect.,"14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect. Excuse me ... change that headline to registered vault. No hyperbole intended. On with the show ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A huge move, 14.7 tonne or 471,000 oz, is out of registered gold on today's vault report ... all of it out of JP Morgan's vault.

Often, but not always, metal moved out of registered ends up being moved out of the vault soon thereafter. Time will tell on that. Regardless, it is a move away from being sold at comex. The size of the move is noteworthy.

Inquiring minds want to know ... who did it? Obviously, it could be any of the comex players who had 14.7 tonne or more in JP Morgan's vault. But that rules out a lot of entities.

I can guess who may be on that short list based on who bought gold recently from JP Morgan or JP Morgan customer accounts. If they stopped metal from those players, the gold would reside in JP Morgan's vault.

Recall that on March 30 of this year JP Morgan issued delivery notices on 10,682 gold contracts. That's 33.2 tonne of gold. I'm talking the house account. The bank. They had shorted gold like f'ing hell during the $150 March rally in an attempt to defend the cabal's fiat. If they hadn't gold would have gone up a lot more than $150.

Here's the procedure to guess who removed the metal: 

Since the metal is in JP Morgan's vault, I looked at all the gold sold by JP Morgan and its customer accounts only. Scrolling back through time, those entities sold 320,000 oz or 3.82 tonne from March 31 onward ... not enough to source today's vault departure.

In other words, if this is metal was bought recently, it would have to include part of the 33.2 tonne sold by JP Morgan's house account on March 30. 

That's extremely interesting. That was an epic sale by JP Morgan. It was the largest sale ever for them, and now it may be involved in metal moving out of comex.

Next, I looked at who stopped (bought) that 33.2 tonne JP Morgan sold on March 30. While you typically don't know which short's metal went to which long, in this case JP Morgan accounted for 63% of the gold sold that day, so you can guess that the big buyers that day got a sizable piece of JP Morgan's metal.

Below are the players who stopped more than one tonne that day. The primary suspects from this list are BofA, Citi and Morgan Stanley customer accounts.

Next I looked at all the ***net*** metal stopped since March 30 by all comex players. This would be from any and all sellers. See the list below. Note that some of this metal may have been acquired from non-JP Morgan sellers, but it would be near impossible to screen further to who stopped metal from only JP Morgan's vault.

https://preview.redd.it/exdzw80fnv1b1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=56832df2c8b05b5875e7984557805b7f5a5634d2

Note that Citi isn't on the list as they sold all of the metal bought on March 30 (plus another 5%). So Citi is off the suspect list and the list is down to 2.

Morgan Stanley customers acquired 8.1 tonne on March 30 and another 1.8 tonne after March 30. Their accrued net purchase since March 30 is 9.9 tonne. It IS possible that they moved their newly bought 9.9 tonne plus another 4.8 tonne they had bought previously, but this is less likely. Furthermore, this all assumes that Morgan Stanley customers are all acting together, or are (mostly) one entity.  I think they are a long shot.

That leaves BofA. What about them?

BofA stopped 13.6 tonne on March 30 and another 16.9 tonne since for a total of 30.5 tonne. Furthermore, they haven't sold **any** gold at all over the last 4 months which is an indication of the direction of their intent ... not flipping metal. The accumulated gold bought since March 30 far surpasses today's vault move of 14.7 tonne. They are the lead suspect.

Who'dve thunk. It wasn't Putin or Xi after all.

The possibility that one of comex's biggest gold players is buying metal and removing it from (at least) registered, is significant. BofA has bought a net 125 tonne since becoming active in early 2021. If this 14.7 tonne is their metal, that would be 12% of their stack.  And maybe more is going out!

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Silver Vaults

JP Morgan did NOT move a truckload into the vaults today, unlike the prior 7 days. Perhaps their silver stack rebuild is complete at 4.2 million oz. If so, that is nothing like the volumes they could effortlessly deliver with the click of the mouse, like 30 million oz at a time. That was before they were downgraded to jay pee pee.

A net 340,000 oz is out of the vault and 400,000 oz was moved out of registered at JP Morgan's vault. BofA?

That's 18% of registered ... over twice the typical. Plus, JP Morgan's 7 day vault re-stack binge is now up to 4.2 million oz of silver. 5 days to first notice. The June inactive month silver contract is counting down to first notice day with 5 (biz) days to go. The OI has stabilized at 1,133 contracts or about 5.5 million oz. Just noticing that the SIL contract (the 1,000 oz micro) has about 1.2 million oz ready to stand for delivery too.

Back to just the SI contract ... while that OI plots as near the average of prior contracts (shown below on the countdown plot), it is much greater than recent months.

&#x200B;

Plus, as a fraction of registered silver, it's one of the highest months over the last 3 years. At the current OI, it accounts for 18.5% of registered whereas the average inactive month (at day 5) is 7.3%:

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold

Gold contracts continue to close with the total OI declining 6,192 contracts. Based on recent price activity, you'd assume this is being driven by longs closing contracts.

https://preview.redd.it/i91alig6wm1b1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=31297c4b924435057c017bd92e2bd80531dcacae

The June contract is now rolling to August, so I track the OI with the sum of the two:

&#x200B;

Based on the June countdown plot, it would appear that of the roll pair contracts (June and August) most of the reduction is in the August contract. I say that because the June contract is 16,000 below the mean, whereas the sum of the two is 39,000 below the mean. The June contract OI is as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/jdk80qrswm1b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=40e5fdb3603b296e3f830848ef2a8677fb016523

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver Vaults

For the 7th day in a row a truckload was received at JP Morgan's vault. If you've not yet been enlightened, a truckload in my jargon is 600,000 oz. A lot of comex silver moves in lots of 600k. That is also a typical payload that can be moved by most class 8 trucks in the USA. Converted to lbs that is 41,000. And for you people that haven't yet converted, that is 18,800 kilos.

So that is now 4.2 million oz of newly arrived metal at JP Morgan's vault over the last 7 days. This is not unlike JP Morgan's restocking of 30 tonne of gold with 6 deposits between March 31 and May 2.

Today, however, the 600k oz deposit at JP Morgan was offset by a 1.1 million oz move out of the vault. Furthermore, 35,000 oz was transferred out of registered at JP Morgan's vault.

For the totals of all 10 comex vaults,  600k was moved in, 2.5 million oz was moved out for a net decline of 1.9 million oz. Also 280,000 oz was moved out of registered to eligible.

The gold vaults saw 1 even tonne move into Brinks:

JP Morgan,Another 7.5 tonne of gold moved out of JP Morgan's registered vault brings the 3 day total to 25.9 tonne and zeros out the entirety of comex 400 oz registered gold.,"Another 7.5 tonne of gold moved out of JP Morgan's registered vault brings the 3 day total to 25.9 tonne and zeros out the entirety of comex 400 oz registered gold. The comex gold contracts had another large reduction in open interest dropping by 10,886 contracts. Give it a yawn. That is typical for this point in the cycle (2 days to first notice).  Basically, there are a lot of folks who hang around with about 5 or 6 days to go who are not hedgers. They are arbs or folks trying to pick up some fiat as the herd rolls or closes. They just close without rolling.

The raw numbers:

That 10,886 decline drops the OI well below the pre-OI surge level from about 3 weeks ago:

https://preview.redd.it/xjbmrdinq92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6adea51f149847d74ad0d99d96b7581023a865f

Currently we are in the last days of the roll period from the June contract to the August contract. See the OI countdown plot below. The number of contracts that closed on the June contract was 42,498 which is exactly the average.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8xkqppht92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=aced6c293570491b5b3faa1f8cb908fc879e22ac

What happened, and almost always happens at this point, is that many of those contracts didn't roll to August. They just closed. The new August contracts totaled 31,219 or 11,279 less. However, this 11,279 is routine for day 2. In fact usually it is even greater at 14,500.

&#x200B;

The June contract OI is now 58% of registered metal in the vault:

https://preview.redd.it/wr5tgow8t92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e979180681727b76d38dc43ce874581637c24fb

Moving on the the gold vaults ...  the story at JP Morgan's vault is more bizarre. There was an additional 242,611 oz (or 7.5 tonne) moved out of JP Morgan's vault. This time the move was from the 400 oz vault.

You may recall the March 2020 near crack up at comex. In an effort to add physical supply, comex changed its rules such that contracts could be settled with 400 oz bars in addition the the usual 100 oz bars. An additional category was added to the vault report specifically for the 400 oz bars.

Considering all of comex (not just JP Morgan), as of yesterday's report only 242,611 oz or 2% of comex registered gold consisted of 400 oz bars. That gives some indication of how many settlements consist of 400 oz bars. Eligible gold consisted of 3,895,686 oz (or 35%) in 400 oz bars.

Therefore, this 242,611 oz move from registered to eligible zeros out comex registered in the 400 oz bar category.

&#x200B;

Was that 242,611 oz move on today's report also BofA?   Over the two prior days BofA (at least it is a high probability it was BofA) moved 18.3 tonne out of JP Morgan's registered (in the 100 oz vault). I'd bet that it was BofA which would bring their 3 day move out of registered to 25.9 tonne.

Moving on to other vault changes ... there was also a 250,778 oz (7.8 tonne) move *into* registered at JP Morgan's vault.

Since that is all getting complicated, I'll cut and paste the raw report for the JP Morgan portion of the vault report:

&#x200B;

I doubt that BofA is moving metal out of, and then back into, registered. So I don't think this is connected to the discussion above. I suspect that we will see someone issue 2,510 contracts early next week.  I'll wait until then to see who's name is printed on the issues and stops report. I have a premonition who that may be.

&#x200B;

Other vault moves ... one tonne into MTB's vault. And the net of all that is ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver

First notice day on the June inactive silver contract is also Monday. FYI ... FND of gold and silver contracts are always synced. The June silver open interest continues flat at 1,114 contracts or 5.57 million oz. Another 1.34 million oz is about to stand for delivery on the micro contract for a total of 6.91 million oz. That'll require 23% of the registered silver.

Speaking of the vault, registered dropped below 30 million oz again. 600 k is out of registered at MTB and 300 k out at HSBC.

The new vault, Asahi, showed 600 k oz arriving with a small offset of 55 k oz departing. The net of all that is ...

Another big day at the gold vaults. There was followup from yesterday's huge move with an additional 118,000 oz or 3.7 tonne moving out of registered at JP Morgan's vault. That is on top of yesterday's 471,000 oz or 14.7 tonne bringing the 2 day total to 18.3 tonne. 

So far, none of that metal has left the vault ... according to the vault reports.

In yesterday's piece, I showed analysis that points the finger at BofA for being the responsible party. You gotta read daily as I can't keep a post concise and repeat the relevant history: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147\_tonne\_vacates\_jp\_morgans\_comex\_gold\_vault/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147_tonne_vacates_jp_morgans_comex_gold_vault/)

These new vault withdrawal numbers are completely consistent with my BofA guess. In fact, strengthens the BofA case because the alternatives had bought much less than BofA recently. Yesterday I mentioned that there is a lot more where that came from ... and there still is.

Separately, there was a 7.0 tonne deposit at Malca Amit's vault. That is a 35% increase. I don't have any recon on who that could be, but I suspect their name will be on the issues and stops report on Monday.

The upcoming June gold contract is an active month and with first notice day on Monday. The OI trajectory has been declining less than usual the last few days as you can see in the plot below.

Usually the number of contracts standing for delivery ranges from 10-20%. Apparently the gold vaults are managed with more cushion than the silver vaults. Why? Probably because a delivery miss on gold would be game over.

The daily change in OI of the front month contract is shown below. It's the derivative of the plot above. Note that today's trading, day 2 before first notice day, usually has the largest decline in OI.

As the June contract appears at the average (bold black line) on the first plot, when adjusted for the reduction in registered gold, the OI is one of the higher contracts. The June contract has 95% of registered gold compared to the average of 75%.

JP Morgan,Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank,"Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are helping the Ukrainian government set up a reconstruction bank to steer public seed capital into rebuilding projects that can attract hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment.

The Ukraine Development Fund remains in the planning stages and is not expected to fully launch until the end of hostilities with Russia. But investors will have a preview this week at a London conference co-hosted by the British and Ukrainian governments.

“So many of today’s long-term challenges are best addressed through blended finance and this is one. You need these vehicles to mobilise capital at scale,” said BlackRock vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand, who will be discussing the work on Wednesday.

The World Bank estimated in March that Ukraine would need $411bn to rebuild after the war, and recent Russian attacks have driven that figure higher.

The Kyiv government engaged BlackRock’s consulting arm in November to determine how best to attract that kind of capital, and then added JPMorgan in February. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced last month that the country was working with the two financial groups and consultants at McKinsey.

No formal fundraising target has been set but people familiar with the discussions say the fund is seeking to raise low-cost capital from governments, donors and international financial institutions and leverage it to attract between five and 10 times as much private investment.

BlackRock and JPMorgan are donating their services, although the work will give them an early look at possible investments in the country. The assignment also deepens JPMorgan’s relationship with a longstanding client. The bank has helped Ukraine raise more than $25bn in sovereign debt since 2010 and led the country’s $20bn debt restructuring last year.

The financiers consulted with private and public sector investors and found they wanted to help Ukraine but were leery not just about war losses but also the country’s governance, lack of transparency and shallow capital markets.

What Ukraine needed, BlackRock advised, was a development finance bank to find investment opportunities in sectors such as infrastructure, climate and agriculture and make them attractive to pension funds and other long-term investors and lenders. JPMorgan was brought in partly for its debt expertise.

“The fund is being set up to also give public and private sector investors the opportunity to invest into specific projects and sectors,” said Stefan Weiler, JPMorgan’s head of debt capital markets for central Europe, Middle East and Africa. “There will be different sectoral funds that the fund identified as priorities for Ukraine. The aim is maximise capital participation.”

The structure calls for the fund to use the lower-cost public money, known as concessional capital, to make initial investments and absorb the first losses.

The notion is that this initial seed capital would be a de-risking mechanism, and it would create the potential for private sector capital to come in at scale,” said Brandon Hall, co-head of BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory arm. “Ukraine will have its own organisation to source and syndicate these local investment opportunities.”

To overcome investor concerns about governance, the fund is expected to stock its board with representatives of international financial institutions and governments and hire investment professionals to execute its strategy.

“Our view is that if you have a strong governance structure and an internationally credible set of stakeholders who are in the leadership position in this fund, then that will go a long way,” Hall said",0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,https://on.ft.com/443yCpg,06/20/2023,06:27:00,DoYouWant_the_Cheese,21,Americas

JP Morgan is almost certainly restocking the silver vault with a third day in a row of a truckload deposit. Plus Degen ""erisorto"" wins the prize. Yesterday I was writing about the roll period where traders close their position on an upcoming active month contract and open a position in the next active month contract. A high fraction of contracts roll forward as such.

Furthermore, near the start of the roll period, there is a large increase in the number of TAS contracts on both the outgoing and incoming contracts. Basically, traders often utilize the trade at settlement (TAS) alternative to close and/or open their positions.

Below is a plot of the TAS volume for each contract. Focus on the pink shaded ""outgoing"" TAS period around day 17 to 8 days to first notice.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e985osbjvf0b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a39de36f63f00125720a7e6396fde1f07c0a327

It's not readily apparent on the above plot, but the TAS surge almost always lasts 5 continuous business days. Furthermore, it never starts on a Wednesday.

The question I asked was ... why doesn't the TAS surge start on Wednesdays?

FYI ... below are the stats on the start of the 5 day surge:

https://preview.redd.it/vzdenod4wf0b1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e04b0042f57f51528efc32e2f2f9e4b1253d7b

Of the 12,500 degenerates who read yesterday's post, only 1 person figured that out.

Aaaand the winner is ""erisorto"" of the SilverDegenClub:

https://preview.redd.it/ff9an4ydwf0b1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=427333350efa3556ba4ff6f365e2ae08816323f1

To add some commentary to erisorto's comments ...  a couple of months back, the sum total of the 5 day TAS surge was a lot less than usual. I thought I could then look at the CoT and see which category of trader had declined by comparing two subsequent CoT reports. If there was some correlation, that could infer which type of trader exploits TAS during those 5 days.

I then realized that that particular 5 day TAS period spanned 2 CoT reports. That fuzzes up the numbers because you then have to look at three subsequent reports to determine the changes.  It fuzzed things up enough that it wasn't apparent which category was involved.

I looked back through time and ALL of the TAS surge numbers spanned 2 reports. What a coincidink!

FYI ... the CoT report is based on traders position at the end of trading on Tuesday (and posted on Friday). The only way to get a clean week to week change between just 2 reports would be if the TAS surge started on a Wednesday. And that's why it never starts on Wednesday!

Everyone will want to start pointing fingers at the CME folks. However, note that the exchange has no rules or guidance about when to roll, or whether to use TAS or not. It's the traders themselves who decide. Apparently, the vast majority of traders decide to not roll their own position on Wednesdays. Furthermore, they mostly avoid Tuesday and Thursday because that splits the change at a 4:1 ratio (or 1:4). By rolling on Monday or Friday, the change is split by a 3:2 (or 2:3) for maximum obfuscation and that is what they do 75% of the time.

The traders are obfuscating data about themselves. The core driver of this is the weekly schedule of the CoT report with positions reported from the Tuesday close. It would be interesting to see if the CFTC required traders to report, say, twice a week. Would the traders modify their 5 day TAS surge?

Congrats to erisorto.  Comex traders have been parading him around the comex pits all day. He's got an interview on CNBC set for tomorrow morning at the opening bell, plus a visit to the White House later in the week.

And on with the new stuff:

Yesterday I wrote about the gold open interest surging ahead by 14,416 contracts on Monday and how that invited a (price) beat down. Although, when I wrote that, the beat down was in progress (on Tuesday). What I didn't know was the beat down reversed that entire OI increase, dropping OI by 14,189 contracts.

One of the larger OI increases immediately followed by one of the larger reductions:

What happened with silver? The Tuesday smack down did drive a few longs out of the May silver contract ... just 22 contracts. But a near offsetting number (18) opened June contracts as you can see below. This may seem like small potatoes but between the tail of the May contract and the upcoming June contract,  7-1/2 million oz will need delivered shortly. The June contract is an inactive month and typically all of those dudes hang around for delivery.

The shorts on the May contract continue to not deliver metal ... zero delivery notices last night. Eight days left to deliver.

# The firm’s market access controls failed to prevent five erroneous orders routed to exchanges and alternative trading systems:

* On January 30, 2019, a firm trader on the Program Trading Agency Desk routed to the market an order to purchase 50,000 shares of an equity security. 
   * The trader intended to enter a limit price of $268.50, but mistakenly input $286.50. 
   * The firm received executions with prices over 5% higher than the last execution in the market prior to entry of this order. 
   * The firm submitted clearly erroneous filings and approximately half of the 50,000-share order (executions above $276.57) were busted. 
* On July 26, 2019, a client entered a market order to sell 86,500 equity shares instead of the intended limit order. 
   * A trader accepted the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The last share price at the time of order entry was $27.23. 
   * The firm received executions at prices down to $22.25, representing an approximately 18% drop. 
* On December 19, 2019, instead of entering a limit-on-close order, a firm trader on the Equity Finance Trading Desk erroneously entered a limit order to buy 230,000 shares of an equity security at $154.17. 
   * The firm routed the order to the market and received executions with prices up to $154.17, which was approximately 3% higher than the prior execution price at order entry of $149.52. 
   * The firm filed a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $154.01 were busted. 
* On March 26, 2020, a client entered a pairs order in the firm’s system. 
   * While a firm algorithm was handling the order, a control paused the order for manual review. 
   * After the review and the resumption of the order, the algorithm handling the order did not refresh the market data to account for the pause. 
   * In less than one minute, the system routed to various execution venues over 80,000 immediate-or-cancel orders, which the execution venues canceled back unfilled because they were priced away from the prevailing market. 
* On April 22, 2021, a client entered a market order to buy 4,765 equity shares but intended to buy 50 shares at a limit price of $4,765. 
   * The Electronic Client Solutions Desk received the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The firm received executions with prices up to $5,077.30, which was approximately 6% higher than the last traded price of $4,799.99. 
   * The firm submitted a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $4,903.50 were busted. 

# The firm’s erroneous order and duplicative order controls were not reasonably designed:  

* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied fixed single order quantity limits ranging from 100,000 to 9,999,999 shares depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client involved in each order. 
   * The firm also applied static single order notional value limits ranging from $25,000,000 to $500,000,000 depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client. Each of these single order quantity and single order notional value limits applied static limits regardless of security and thus failed to consider the individual characteristics of the security. 
   * The firm further applied average daily volume limits ranging from 25 to 50 percent based on the specific desk, trader, and/or client.
   *  With the exception of one desk’s single order quantity control, the firm’s single order quantity, single order notional value, and average daily value thresholds were too large to be effective, and the firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set them at such levels.
* Moreover, many of the above referenced size controls triggered “soft blocks” when applicable thresholds were reached. 
   * In contrast to a “hard block,” which generally prevents an order from being submitted by automatically rejecting it, a soft block pauses an order until the block is overridden or the order is cancelled back or modified. 
      * For most of the relevant period, however, the firm’s written supervisory procedures did not address how to handle, document, and review soft block overrides. 
      * Accordingly, the firm’s controls that relied on soft blocks did not prevent the entry of certain erroneous orders. 
      * By January 2021, the firm implemented changes to its supervisory requirements relating to soft blocks that included tracking and reviews of soft block overrides and adding compliance trainings and updates to its written supervisory procedures on the handling of soft blocks.
* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied single order limit price controls based on fixed percentages away from the National Best Bid and Offer, ranging from three to 15 percent depending on the desk, trader, and/or client involved. 
   * Like the firm’s size controls, certain limit price thresholds were set too high to be effective. 
   * In particular, the limit price controls generally exceeded the numerical guidelines for clearly erroneous transactions. 
   * The firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set its limit price thresholds at levels greater than the definition of a clearly erroneous transaction. 
      * Additionally, for the same reasons previously noted above, the firm’s supervisory system for soft blocks was deficient for most of the relevant period. 
      * In October 2020, the firm began introducing a price control that applied different thresholds to differently priced securities.  
* Furthermore, the firm did not have a reasonable duplicative order control. 
   * The firm did apply a risk control that checked orders with the same symbol, side, and quantity. 
   * This control triggered a hard block if more than 50,000 order messages with the same symbol, side, and quantity were sent within two seconds. 
   * However, the 50,000-order threshold, which was applied separately to each of the firm’s connections to external venues, was too high to be effective. 
   * The firm provided no documented rationale supporting why such a high threshold was reasonable. 

As of July 2022, the firm had implemented additional controls to prevent the entry of orders that—based on price and/or size of the order relative to the market—could potentially lead to unintended market impact.

Perhaps even more than Wexner, the Crowns are a testament to how the worlds of organized crime and corporate power have mixed over the years to produce elites who are truly untouchable. With a long-standing dominant role in the American military-industrial complex as well as other facets of the corporate world, the Crowns have a history of doing what’s necessary – whether legal or illegal – to get what they want to advance their political agendas and grow their own power. Even presidents and the Pentagon have been unable to successfully challenge them.

Typically there is a total OI increase during this portion of the roll, so today's total OI increase of 3,166 is normal compared to the average of 3,570. You can see the OI cycle below where the solid black line is the arithmetic average:

Isolating the June and August contracts shows the same impact:

Meanwhile back at the May contract which is currently in the delivery period, 218 net new gold contracts were written on Tuesday.  There's still plenty of time left, so call your broker and buy a few gold bars for near immediate delivery.

The issues and stops report shows mostly JP Morgan customers selling gold to other JP Morgan customers. The big players that were very active earlier in the month, BofA and Citi, have ceased activity for now.

Let's talk silver!

The upcoming June contract's OI has increased to 981, or about 4.9 million oz, and is much higher than recent months. This is an inactive month and typically, these contracts stay open and take delivery. You can see that in the flat bold black average line which stays mostly flat during the run up to first notice day. That's in sharp contrast to the active months where OI is plunging toward FND. Real men buy inactive months ... apparently.

&#x200B;

That 4.9 million oz is 18% of registered vault totals. If you think of it relative to the registered vault total, suddenly the June contract OI is almost twice the average inactive month. See the plot below.

Perhaps that's why some silver is arriving at the vaults lately.

Speaking of the silver vaults, after increasing for each of the last 3 days, 220,000 oz departed the vaults:

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Gold Vaults

The gold vaults saw 55,000 oz arrive at JP Morgan's vault. There have been six 160,000 oz deposits over the last 28 business days. Perhaps today's report is the final installment of JP Morgan's gold rebuild as this brings the recent total deposited to 31.7 tonnes. Recall that they sold 33.5 tonnes on the April contract as they apparently defended the cabal's fiat during the March gold rally.

JP Morgan,"We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan?","We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan? Microstrategy has an insane plan. It's wildly complex and super intricate. After much analysis I have concluded the following:

When BTC goes up, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC goes down, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC crabs, MS buys Bitcoin

When Michael Saylor is sued, MS buys Bitcoin

It may be a bit hard to follow but I can dumb in down for you: MS buys Bitcoin.

I even made a joke of it here, and I think we generally view MS as on 'our side' but MS currently owns around 140,000 BTC which is about 0.72% of circulating supply. It's doesn't sound like *that* much but it's pretty close to close to an entire 1%. In fact, it's almost certain that they will own more than 1% of the total supply at the end of all this. And that percentage is deceiving because we don't know how many BTC is permanently burned, but it's likely quite a lot, so the actual percentage they'll own will be even greater. Chainalysis estimates that up to 20% of the Bitcoin already issued may be permanently lost, which means they own more like 0.9% of what's left.

To put their buys into perspective, in just 2 years since March 2021, they managed to purchase 0.25% of circulating supply. Estimates have put the final Bitcoin to be mined in 2140. Of course, most of us won't be alive, but if MS continues at current rates, they'll have another 2.5% of supply in just 10 years. This is a hard estimate as their are many factors to this but it's fair enough I think. Imagine how much they'll earn in 30 years alone, when we would have all grown old(er).

I don't think we'll look at then the way we do now.",0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12fz6jg/we_encourage_and_laugh_with_microstrategy_now_but/,04/09/2023,02:35:43,OneThatNoseOne,324,Americas

JP Morgan,JP Morgan Chase earnings report,"JP Morgan Chase earnings report The 2023 Q2 earnings report for JPMorgan Chase has just been released. Overall, the ER is a remarkable demonstration of the durability and power of the top bank. JPM's results, both top and bottom line, exceeded market forecasts. The fact that the bank declared a solid balance sheet during and after a highly tumultuous time for the banking industry is, in my opinion, more significant.   
The last one or two quarters have been described by certain media as the most difficult for banks since the 2008 crisis. JPM was able to keep a healthy standardised CET1 capital ratio of 13.8% even after the First Republic deal. J.P. Morgan was able to negotiate a favourable price because they were the only reliable buyer for FRC. In a back-of-the-envelope analysis of the transaction, Matt Levine of Bloomberg noted how J.P. Morgan receives good upside and regulatory protection while sharing a large portion of the potential losses if the loans default. Although the estimated $500 million in annual net income for the agreement is small in comparison to the $40 billion or so they already generate, it demonstrates that a bank like JPMorgan can take advantage of the crisis.  
The bank currently has $1.4 trillion in cash and short-term securities, which is a lot of liquidity. I have no doubt that JPM will be able to fulfil these new standards and keep its fortress balance sheet, even though there may be some capital changes and liquidity in the near future as the banking industry adapts to new rules.  
Given the current instability in the banking industry, regulatory standards may be modified in various ways. With Basel III's completion, Dimon himself anticipates ""material changes"" to capital and liquidity. He continued by issuing a warning that the market as a whole as well as end customers would probably be affected by these regulatory changes in the real world.

JP Morgan,Registered silver continues to drain with another truckload out of registered at Brinks. JP Morgan's gold vault sees 5 tonne hasta la vaulta. That is 3% of their vault total.,"Registered silver continues to drain with another truckload out of registered at Brinks. JP Morgan's gold vault sees 5 tonne hasta la vaulta. That is 3% of their vault total. &#x200B;

Following up from last week's analysis, the July contract continues adding net new contracts for immediate delivery. Friday saw 32 move contracts tacked on or 160,000 koz. The cumulative after 5 days is 402 contracts or 2.01 million oz or 5.8% of registered silver.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syii3vhe17bb1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd535a20564b936aed1d04018e6614108bf1eb1

At the silver vaults one even truckload was removed from Brinks' vault. That is 3 days in a row where one even truckload was moved out of registered. I'd surmise that this party is whoever bought part of the 12 million oz sold by Standard Chartered (and delivered out of Brinks' vault). Only 3 parties were issued more than 1.8 million oz that day ...

&#x200B;

* JP Morgan customer accounts -    6.070 million oz
* BofA                                                   2.565 million oz
* Morgan Stanley house account - 2.225 million oz.

Time may tell, or at least indicate, who is moving metal out of registered. It all 12 million oz moves out, that'd be 17 more truckloads.  And, for the record, I'm not predicting that.

&#x200B;

I thought it was odd that silver was moving out of registered in 600 koz batches even thought it hasn't (yet) moved out of the vault. I've documented that silver moves in or out of the vault in 600 koz tranches, but moves from registered to eligible or versa vice could be different.

I don't know if vaults segregate registered from eligible. If it was just a digital reassignment, you'd think they could change status of any amount of silver with just a click the mouse. If they actually move the metal, there could be size considerations to change status.

Curiosity got the best of me and I did the stats. Moves in and out of registered ARE more frequent than most other size moves except small moves (-250,000 to +50,000).  See the histogram below.

And those are thousands of oz on the x-axis:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7cctiwwh67bb1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d58f74518c3bbdb4fbf4f17158bc07e26f69cb5

But if you consider the percentage of total oz moved, the truckload size change jumps out:

https://preview.redd.it/sc55raxna7bb1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd21a233c2f840bda40cd4f36d7bd5a552f571e

It's possible that there are moves into or out of registered in 600 koz lots only because it arrives or departs the vaults in those sizes. I'm saying that because often silver moves in or out of the vault occur before or soon after the change from registered. To get to the bottom of that, I'd have to strip out moves that weren't associated with a move in or out of the vault. Ain't doing that right now. Maybe someday.

At the end of all that ... I don't know why these 3 Brinks' moves have been 3 sequential 600 koz changes and the metal remains in eligible.

MTB also moved 100 koz out of registered:

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold Vaults

JP Morgan's vault sees 5 even tonne (160 koz) moved out of the vault. That is 3.1% of that vaults total silver. Depository Services of Delaware also sees 12 koz depart.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ckuiqiqjd7bb1.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=33c4e5a7b7b87b223605261a187caaf2e4bd6cfe

The JP Morgan withdrawal isn't connected to any recent moves from registered. The last move exceeding 5 tonne from JP Morgan's registered was May 23, or 34 biz days ago.

Perhaps their recent gold vault build will be reversed:

Accepted a NG offer from JPMC for 1.3X the money but I feel I may have made a mistake. Going into a finance first company rather than tech first company.

JP Morgan,"JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz.","JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz. The total of JP Morgan's vault of registered silver has dwindled from over 40 million oz at the start of the silver squeeze to 8.1 million oz.

The JP Morgan vault would be the total of JP Morgan, the bank's silver, and customer silver. Typically JP Morgan's house account doesn't keep much silver in registered so this move out today is likely silver owned by customer accounts.

A couple of weeks ago I had written that I identified BofA as removing vast quantities of gold, 25.9 tonne, from registered at JP Morgan's vault.  This could be BofA's silver.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another\_75\_tonne\_of\_gold\_moved\_out\_of\_jp\_morgans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another_75_tonne_of_gold_moved_out_of_jp_morgans/)

&#x200B;

JP Morgan's eligible metal stands at 133.3 million oz. From that, deduct the 103 million oz that is ""owned"" by SLV's authorized participants (and probably a few other parties) which leaves 30.3 million oz. Again, that would be the total of customer and the bank's silver.

I had documented the occasions where it became apparent that the JP Morgan, the bank, was out of silver during 2022 although they have likely restocked to some extent. I always pay special attention to JP Morgan as they are the cabal's lead banker.

Today's comex total of 27.3 million oz is a 6.5 year low last seen in December 29, 2016.

The record low was just 6 months earlier at 22,482,450 oz which occurred for a 7 day stretch ending June 14, 2016.

Another day with no delivery notices on the June silver contract where 2.16 million oz awaits delivery. Same on the micro silver contract where another 324 koz await delivery. On the micro silver contract, the naked short is CME. Yes those are the folks that run the comex exchange.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  July silver contracts

Yesterday I mentioned there was a surge in ""privately negotiated trades"" on the upcoming July silver contract which arrested the two week surge in open interest.  The heightened PNT trades continued with 3,361 contracts. Despite that the total OI had a modest gain of 1,266 contracts:

It is interesting to note that the July contract OI at day 9 is 12.5 times the registered vault total, and that is the highest in the post covid era. But you should skip this plot too:

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold Vaults

There was a large move out of the gold vaults at JP Morgan's vaults, 221 koz or 6.86 tonne. That's 2.5% of JP Morgan's vault total and 1% of comex total.

A couple of weeks ago I documented huge moves at JP Morgan's gold vault as metal  moved out of registered. Now it appears that it is going out of the vault.

On May 23 and 24 there were 589 koz or 18.3 tonne moved out of registered. I posted an analysis that showed that the likely perp was almost certainly BofA. They are the only party that has net stopped that much gold, specifically 30.5 tonne since March 30 of this year and 124 tonne over the last 2-1/2 years.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147\_tonne\_vacates\_jp\_morgans\_comex\_gold\_vault/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147_tonne_vacates_jp_morgans_comex_gold_vault/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13rrxjy/the\_2\_day\_departure\_of\_gold\_out\_of\_jp\_morgans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13rrxjy/the_2_day_departure_of_gold_out_of_jp_morgans/)

Since those moves out of registered, JP Morgan's gold vault has been fairly quiet. It isn't a certainty that this is BofA's gold that was 1) recently bought at comex and 2) moved out of registered and 3) now moved out of the vault. But it is likely. 

If it is BofA's gold, this 6.86 tonne would represent 38% of the that 18.3 tonne moved out of registered on May 23 and 23. We may get some clarity in the days ahead if there is a follow up move(s) out of the vault.

Why care? BofA has been a huge buyer of gold at comex over the last 2-1/2 years. They have bought a net 4.0 million oz (124 tonne). IF (notice that is in uppercase), all of that was in JP Morgan's vault, that would represent 80% of the JP Morgan vault total. Yesterday's move of 6.86 tonne is only 6% of BofA's net stopped gold. How's that for an avalanche waiting to fall?

The numbers to the oz:

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Silver Vaults

A truckload (640 koz) was deposited at Loomis' vault and a half truckload departed Brinks for a net increase of 361 koz:

No change in registered, and even with 6 continuous days of no change in registered. That is no big deal.

I hear that yesterday one of my (blocked) trolls on Twitter is making a deal about there being 5 days of no change in registered silver. BFD. In fact, it is the 4th time **this year** that has occurred.  Even after yesterday's 6th day in a row of no change, a continuous 6 day span has happened **3 times this year**.

It's still about 10 days too early to look at the countdown to first notice on the July silver contract, however I can't help but notice that the OI decline is less than average:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atgitobcd16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e3d70dae95e6edc754db1b3bb6e117997dcade

This next plot is the daily change in OI ... essentially the derivative of the plot above. Note that the daily decline is running a couple of thousand contracts per day below average.

https://preview.redd.it/9cxkl8tdd16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=f30b6ba11498d193f4569daba0f8ba705a96491e

Meanwhile traders are flooding into the September contract causing a surge in total OI. See the plot below.

Note the blue line for the May 23 contract also experienced an OI surge at this point in the cycle. I'll have to think about why they are mirroring each other.

https://preview.redd.it/8fxlgoi1g16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45b37db55b061074291ccbba31deea21f3235e4

Yesterday the OI increase for the September contract (7,296) was more than double the decline for July (3,167). Usually, during the core of the roll, these are offsetting. The total OI increase is 4,382.

https://preview.redd.it/0irkrj49e16b1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd75b58dc3188094aec25ff0b3caafb8b09e54d6

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    comex vaults

Yesterday was ""take it away Tuesday"" at the comex vaults. One truckload (600 koz) departed JP Morgan and Loomis' vaults, 476 koz was out of Delaware Depository and 100 koz was out of CNT. All of that was somewhat offset by a 487 koz deposit at JP Morgan and 300 koz at Brinks.

The net change was 978 koz OUT OF THE VAULT:

https://preview.redd.it/ht16uy1nh16b1.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=a01f6d1361ea8579346c19f2e7841b9f18279476

&#x200B;

But that was nothing compared to gold.  Brinks' gold vault saw a 162 koz or 5.0 tonne departure. That is 3.4% of Brinks' vault total.

Scrolling back in time, Brinks had a 367 koz move out of registered on May 30, just a couple of weeks ago. That date was first notice day on the June contract so I have to try to pair that move with a gold buyer. However, nobody stopped that much gold, so I can't point the finger at anyone specifically. The largest buyer(s) that day were JP Morgan customer accounts at 353 koz ... fairly close. It is possible the vault move was JP Morgan customer account gold.

Here was the detail from that day:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely\_odd\_day\_for\_comex\_silver\_all\_just\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely_odd_day_for_comex_silver_all_just_to/)

Here we are 10 biz days later and 162 koz moves out of the vault. It's logical to connect those, although that is not certain. Perhaps that 5 tonne will show up at JP Morgan's vault or perhaps another large comex player is buying gold at comex, moving it out of registered and then OUT OF THE VAULT.

Asahi, the new vault, showed a 48 koz deposit.

The next day, Bank of America takes the lead by selling $15B worth of bonds ([SuperStonk DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsioql/the_complete_bank_of_america_gamestop_dd/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/bofa-to-set-record-for-largest-bank-bond-sale-at-15-billion#xj4y7vzkg), April 16, 2021).

So if JP Morgan needed to raise some serious money *without getting a bailout*, buying another bank in a sweetheart deal seems like another way to juice up JP Morgan's balance sheet with some good PR. According to [CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/01/business/first-republic-purchase-hnk-intl/index.html),

>First Republic ... had assets of **$229.1 billion** as of April 13. As of the end of last year, it was the nation’s **14th-largest bank**, according to a ranking by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States with total global assets of **nearly $4 trillion** as of March 31.

Now that JP Morgan picked up First Republic, their total assets increases by about $229B (about 5.7%).  And, according to Reuters \[[Factbox](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-deal-collapsed-first-republic-explained-2023-05-01/)\], JP Morgan just got a pretty sweet deal with First Republic Bank:

* JPMorgan Chase will pay **$10.6 billion** to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC)
* Will **not** assume First Republic's corporate **debt** or preferred stock
* FDIC to provide [loss share agreements](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/) with respect to most acquired loans

So JP Morgan paid $10.6B to pick up $229B (less than 5c on the dollar), passes on the corporate debt, and shares losses with the FDIC so that:

* JPMorgan expects one-time gain of **$2.6 billion** post-tax at closing
* Estimated to add roughly **$500 million to net income** and be accretive to tangible book value per share

**That's a pretty damn good deal.**  Let's look more into what the FDIC says about [shared loss agreements (SLA)](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/jqe3z9ira9xa1.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=cefb80e4cb215985e0ac3c5836fe1c77316b7b7e)

The FDIC absorbs a portion of the loss on assets sold through resolving a failed bank ""sharing the loss with the purchaser of the failed bank"".  *Sounds like the FDIC just took one for the team.*

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/7qob3s6qb9xa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bfd02469344d43cef0f50540691e63c9c08b22a)

According to the FDIC, loss sharing is basically an 80/20 split (except for after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis when the split was 95/5, which has ended).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/alkxtvz6c9xa1.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d900e614b00abc103fb360936f421a708a047e2)

According to the FDIC, resolving a failed bank with loss sharing is supposed to be based on **the least costly option** (to the Deposit Insurance Fund).  (We've seen this least costly option come up in resolving bank failures before with the FDIC and Federal Reserve contemplating requiring Too Big To Fail banks sell destined-to-fail bonds to absorb losses and reduce payouts by the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund \[[SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/zdebh6/comment_against_the_federal_reserve_fdic_proposal/)\])

According to [Investopedia, JPMorgan To Pay FDIC $10.6 Billion For First Republic, This is What It Gets](https://www.investopedia.com/what-does-jpmorgan-get-in-first-republic-deal-7487296), resolving FRC bank failure will cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $13B.

>The FDIC will take a **$13 billion hit to its fund** and *provide $50 billion in financing*.

Wait, the **FDIC is providing $50B to finance JPM buying FRC?!**

https://preview.redd.it/4j4du9umk9xa1.png?width=3492&format=png&auto=webp&s=33069c143c5351f6b2e616e6c826fc543090e181

The FDIC loaned JP Morgan $50B to buy the failed First Republic bank for $10.6B.  $30B of that was used to repay a [rescue deal from March (last month)](https://www.investopedia.com/first-republic-s-usd30b-rescue-by-jp-morgan-citi-and-bank-of-america-7367932) backed by JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.  Which means JP Morgan gets their money back from the previous rescue *plus* an **extra $9.4B** out of this loan deal to buy $229B worth of assets from First Republic.

On top of that, JP Morgan splits losses with the FDIC 80/20 with the FDIC covering 80% of loan losses for the next 5-7 years (5 years for commercial loans and 7 years for residential mortgages).

**Imagine if a bank** ***loans you*** **$9,400 to buy a $229,000 house.**  No down payment.  Just ""here's $9,400 and the keys to that $229,000 house"". Oh, and the bank will cover 80% of the cost for anything that breaks in the house for the next 5-7 years.  *This is an insane deal.*

**Which truly makes one wonder if this is a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout for JP Morgan,** the *only* Tier 4 GSIB as the most interconnected bank with the most complex banking relationships and the highest overall systemic risk rating.

Are we going to see:

1. Fat bonuses at JP Morgan?
2. Followed by news about JP Morgan posing a systemic risk?
3. Followed by calls to bail out JP Morgan to save pensions?

This is exactly why anonymity and privacy is so important in crypto as a future of finance and potential TradFi and banking replacement/improvement, as well as the significance of decentralization","19 States accused JP Morgan on closing accounts on religious or political beliefs. This is exactly why anonymity and privacy is so important in crypto as a future of finance and potential TradFi and banking replacement/improvement, as well as the significance of decentralization 19 states have come out accusing JP Morgan of of closing accounts and discriminating against customers due to their political or religious beliefs. A letter to JP Morgan said ""the bank had canceled major organizations' checking accounts and  had asked screening questions focused on religion and politics before  reinstating them"" JPMorgan also allegedly declined a proposal on participation in a  survey for the Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index, which is meant to determine ""freedom of expression and freedom of religion or  belief as a standard part of doing business,"". JPMorgan had received a score of 15% for the index in 2022 which obviously shows their massive bias and give credibility to the claims.

It's significant enough that JP Morgan would randomly close accounts, and defenders would have said it's due to anti-money laundering politcies/bank secrecy act etc, absolutely ridiculous and makes their intentions clear when they ask questions that screen customers religious and political beliefs before customers have just a *chance* to get their accounts reinstated.

There's been a bit of a push and pull in crypto whereby some people disagree with the need to anonymity. I'd argue that these are privileged people who've had no issues with banks having their information, but they only had no issues because they had money, which the bank wanted. The government view of crypto regulation is definitely to peel back that anonymity as far back as they can. But this situation shows exaclly why anonymity is important, as it immediately solves problems of discrimination as well as safety of the individuals as well so as not to become target, either of societal or corporate discrimination, or criminals.

And crypto balances it very well with allowing *privacy* but not *confidentiality*. Privacy means a lack of direct intrusion into private or personal affairs, so an anonymous blockchain has privacy, but not confidentiality.  This as confidentiality deals more with a complete block of access to information like the government sealing documents and offering no access at all.

It also ties right back into decentralization, where no centralized entity has the power to deny access to services on the blockchain. We all know that power corrupts and JP Morgan has way too much of that. Instead we have a decentralized blockchain where it would take a (mostly) democratic process to deny access to services, and even then it's pretty rare.

JP Morgan,"Gold OI declines 11,345 contracts and has now given back most of the OI surge from 2 weeks ago. Plus JP Morgan adds another truckload for the 5th day in a row.","Gold OI declines 11,345 contracts and has now given back most of the OI surge from 2 weeks ago. Plus JP Morgan adds another truckload for the 5th day in a row. The upcoming inactive June silver contract's open interest continues to drift upwards despite the chaos on the gold contracts. It now stands at 1,120 contracts. Typically nearly all of the OI of these inactive month contracts stand for delivery. First notice day is in 7 days.

https://preview.redd.it/i2jsvm8o9u0b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=416b79e3fb992185b1478ed0ef595be4ed71ffb3

I've rarely mentioned the micro silver contract. The ticker is SIL and it is a 1,000 oz deliverable contract. A guy on twitter, [@EsScalping](https://twitter.com/EsScalping), pointed out that there is also an ""E-mini"" silver contract. That ticker is QI and is for 2,500 oz but is only financially settled. You can't get silver on QI so it'll never impact comex vault totals.

Back to the SIL 1,000 oz micro contract. I mentioned yesterday that what's been happening is the CME group is making a market in the SIL contract.

Essentially there are three fairly big buyers and no sellers. The CME folks buy metal on the 5,000 oz SI contract and sell it to those 3 players on the 1,000 oz SIL contract.

I should probably say, I'm referring to the physical market ... those that stand for delivery. There may be others trading paper contracts, but I can't identify them.  I'm addressing the names I see on the issues and stops report for physical metal.

The CME group has sold 21.44 million oz net since 2019 and those three customer accounts have bought 21.42 million oz. The cumulative net tally for each is as follows:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/clp4e4kbdu0b1.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=15a0225d8abc6de93575d4cc963a329c5a0b2a08

There's been a few bubbas that have occasionally stopped contracts, but you can see it is round off.

When the CME folks buy metal at the SI contract, it is essentially like some combination of these 3 customer accounts buying it. The metal just passes through, usually the same day.

Below are plots of the issues, stops and net for 1) the CME group, and 2) the largest buyer, Advantage customer accounts. Note that Advantage has rarely sold any silver.

I've considered adding the two contracts (SI and SIL) together for my graphics. The only reason I haven't is that the reader will have a difficult time tracking the raw numbers from the report to the graphs. Personally, I like to do that when viewing plots to gain confidence in the data. For now, I haven't added them. Currently, some of the larger issues and stops from the SIL contract are greater than the smaller, inactive months, on the SI contract. So I may start adding them for plots in the future.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold

The gold open interest fell another 11,345 contracts and has now given back much of the OI surge that occurred 2 weeks ago:

The June active month is 7 days to first notice and has now fallen below the average:

Over lunch today I listened to a podcast that mentioned an increase in gold EFP (exchange for physical) volume. EFP's are a swap of a comex futures contract with a ""physical"" contract in London. Settlement by EFP rarely induces metal leaving London vaults.

As far as an EFP surge, I'm not seeing it. I track the cumulative EFP volume after zeroing the meter at day 44 (the start of the OI plateau). See the plot below. The June gold contract was riding the average line (the bold black line ) until recently and then drifted slightly below trend.

That said, the number of contracts that routinely vacate comex by EFP is huge. Usually it exceeds the total gold in registered as you can see below. The current registered gold is shown as the horizontal green line.

Yesterday I forgot to mention that the new vault operated by Asahi Depository, showed 1.2 million oz moved to registered and that is added to the comex vault registered total.

The day prior's statement for Asahi had all zeros. It was odd that their account statement didn't show metal being present the day before or being ""received"" on yesterday's report.  It just showed the ""adjustment"", which is the move to registered. Typically a move to registered has a deduct from eligible. Essentially, it just magically arrived.

Magic accounting. I wonder what's actually in Asahi's vault?

Little bit of a history of the gold/silver standard and what amounted to the Panic of 1896.  What’s interesting in this history lesson are the players and what they were trying to achieve – Rothschild and JP Morgan.  130 years later the same lessons are being told but the main players have not changed and the ultimate gain is banking as opposed to railway. 

JP Morgans undocumented manipulation of the gold and silver market has long been a speculated rumour and somewhat difficult thing to prove. So today we thought we’d take you on a journey back to 1895 – where speculation and government collusion were in fact tools used by JP Morgan and Rothschilds to both save the US from economic collapse and line their own pockets.  The result was the strengthening of these financial institutions, which over the years have used the same playbook to further enhance their market dominance and back-handed deals rewarding and not punishing their financial prowess.

The playbook? Wait for the government to fall into a panic or a financial crisis. Save the day. Manipulate markets to your advantage, and walk away with monopolistic powers.  In 1914 JP Morgan emerged as the major player and owner of railways in the US.  2023 JP Morgan emerges as the major player in US banking.  Both a mechanism of trade control – 1914 Industrial revolution trade control and 2023 banking and finance trade control.

**What’s a Panic?**

Rather than googling financial crisis – google panic, Pre-1900 the panic terminology appears to apply to any bubble or distorted market leading to market manipulation and panic, otherwise now known as a financial crisis.  Some examples include:

**Panic of 1819**

This was the first US widespread panic, driven by the end of the Napoleonic wars, it was compounded by asset bubbles in speculation in public lands – fueled by the unrestrained issue of ‘paper money’

**Panic of 1837**

Another panic set off from a real estate bubble and erratic American banking policy. Deflation set in with profit, prices and wages dropping.

**Panic of 1873**

This panic started in Europe with a stock market crash leading to investors liquidating bonds, in particular railway bonds in the US due to overdevelopment and speculation in railway.

**The Panic of 1893 and 1896**

Triggered by factors such as a failed coup in Argentina, a run on gold in the U.S. Treasury, and an oversupply of silver.

You see the gist here – gets a little 1800 repetitive and it was no wonder property prices remained fairly subdued throughout the 19th Century. It appears in the 20th Century, those Panic lessons may have been well and truly forgotten and the same old real estate lax banking bubbles emerged.

But for this history lesson we will focus on 1873 and 1893, and the great fortune JP Morgan was able to accumulate during this time and the role of gold and bonds that saw JP Morgan emerge as the US’s most powerful financial and railroad tycoon.

**Railroad Playbook**

JP Morgan cofounded Drexel, Morgan and company in 1871, becoming JP Morgan and company in 1895.  What seemed like a bad time to be in business turned out to be fortuitous to JP Morgan.  The Panic of 1873 started with the rampant inflation driven from overspeculation in railroads and the demonetization of silver in Germany and the US.  Following the American Civil War, 33,000 miles of railroad were built between 1868 and 1873.  Within the railroad craze a large infusion of cash was raised via bonds.  In 1871 Germany demonetized silver leading to an oversupply of silver, particularly in the US who mined most of the supply.  In 1873 the US passed the Coinage Act of 1873 backing the US dollar to a de facto gold standard.   This immediately depressed silver prices further, reduced money supply and raised interest rates hurting farmers.  People then shied away from long term bonds and collapsed the railway bond market.

In 1873 the precipice of the Panic happened when Jay Cooke and Company couldn’t sell millions of dollars of Northern Pacific Railway Bonds leading to its bankruptcy. By 1874 60 railroads had gone bankrupt 

In 1875 Congress backed the USD with gold helping to curb and stabilize the dollar.

It was 10 years after the collapse in railway bonds that JP Morgan emerged as a railway force, this time reorganizing railways, merging them and taking stakes, such as in 1885 when he arranged a merger between New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad.  

**Morgan-Belmont Syndicate**

Following the 1893 Panic, paper money was being exchanged for gold from treasury, draining the US Treasury of gold.  The hot money movement as it was later known had all the hallmarks of a self compelling bank run on Treasury due to a distrust of the US government’s gold reserve.  There was a rapid decline in gold reserves from $121,0000,000 on January 1st 1893 to $66,000,000 on February 1st 1894.  Under these circumstances the government used 4 subscriptions of $50,000,000 of 5% 10 year bonds over a 1894-1895.  But each time treasury again saw gold continue to pour out of treasury.  Speculative international transactions prompted by the fear of the ceasing of the gold standard saw another net outflow of $84,000,000 between October 1894 and January 1895, investors were liquidating bank balances and railroad bonds for gold and sending this gold to Europe at an increasing rate.

To assist with the US predicament a famous meeting between President Cleveland and JP Morgan in 1895 produced a syndicate and its contract on February 8th 1895.  The contract failed to name syndicate members with a veil of secrecy, although it is now known the syndicate included both Rothschilds and JP Morgan to name some of the more notable firms.  The contract was for the syndicate to bolster gold stock and stop outflows. The syndicate agreed to purchase 3,500,000 ounces of gold and sell it to the government with 4% 30 year bonds.  

The syndicate acquired $62,315,400 in government bonds at a 4% return, which they sold at 3 ¾% almost immediately for $68,833,591 – a tidy $5,000,000 immediate profit. Additional to the gold they delivered, within a week the syndicate saw other gold inflows of $10,000,000 from domestic holders.

The second condition was the syndicate exert control on the market (manipulate) to stop gold outflows.  The syndicate contract lasted 6 months, with the Syndicate manipulating control over the exchange rate to ensure enhanced profits from the arrangements

*‘The unique and imprecise manner by which authority was delegated by the government to a private syndicate to control the foreign-exchange market would be unthinkable in modern time’*

During this time it was also identified that the syndicate used moral suasion (more manipulation) to ensure other gold holders/investors did not withdraw further gold.  They appealed to these investors by giving bonds at preferential terms they would adhere to the ‘ship no gold’ agreement. Articles at the time supported the Syndicate and the moral suasion such as the United States Investor revered the Syndicate for stopping the previous deflation 

‘*To those persons to criticize the bond syndicate for keeping the price of the exchange at such high figures, it is sufficient to say that had the Syndicate not intervened, the cost of paying debts cold be even greater than at present, because gold would be in transit instead of exchange.’*

The Syndicate succeeded in reinvigorating faith in the US government and dollar and saw a period of prosperity follow, but it seems from this point the US Government owed the architects of the syndicate a favour.   And it appears during this time the Syndicate learnt the economic benefits of precious metal manipulation.

The end of the agreement saw Europe liquidate some of these railway bonds, which we’re sure became the icing on JP Morgans Railway cake as he emerged in 1902 as the largest US railway owner, controlling 5,000 miles of US railroads.

**JP Morgan and First Republic Bank today**

We all know this more recent story of JP Morgans takeover of multiple banks – Bear Sterns, First Republic Bank with the government again leaning on the financial Behemoth to help save the US dollar.  But just like in 1895 the favors and profits to be made are enhancing both the strength and influence of JP Morgan. 

During the First Republic deal laws were broken and profits were made, putting JP Morgan in a stronger monopolistic position in US banking, just like the railways in 1902.

The US law that needed to be circumvented, as JPMorgan ‘*is so big that by* **law it would not be allowed to buy First Republic** *because no one bank can have more than a 10 per cent market’*

And the profit made by JP Morgan: *‘Recognize an upfront, one-time, post-tax gain of approximately $2.6 billion, which does not reflect the approximately $2.0 billion dollars of post-tax restructuring costs anticipated over the next 18 months’*

History Repeats.

**Finally just a little bit of 2023/1873 comparison**

* 1998 tech boom leading to the 2000 collapse- with overinvestment and hype in a new technology – railway vs internet (Panic of 1873)
* 2008 Financial Crisis and deflation (Panic of 1895)
* And finally 2022 inflation, 14 years after the GFC, bought on by Covid, compared  the 1917  during and proceeding World War 1. With inflation in 1920 hitting 25% and 1921 a sharp reversal -15% so will we see a similar pattern in 2024/2025?

 History clearly tells us it may be a good time to start gold and silver stacking because if 2024 looks anything like 1921 we are in line for a deflationary shock….

JP Morgan,14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect.,"14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect. Excuse me ... change that headline to registered vault. No hyperbole intended. On with the show ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A huge move, 14.7 tonne or 471,000 oz, is out of registered gold on today's vault report ... all of it out of JP Morgan's vault.

Often, but not always, metal moved out of registered ends up being moved out of the vault soon thereafter. Time will tell on that. Regardless, it is a move away from being sold at comex. The size of the move is noteworthy.

Inquiring minds want to know ... who did it? Obviously, it could be any of the comex players who had 14.7 tonne or more in JP Morgan's vault. But that rules out a lot of entities.

I can guess who may be on that short list based on who bought gold recently from JP Morgan or JP Morgan customer accounts. If they stopped metal from those players, the gold would reside in JP Morgan's vault.

Recall that on March 30 of this year JP Morgan issued delivery notices on 10,682 gold contracts. That's 33.2 tonne of gold. I'm talking the house account. The bank. They had shorted gold like f'ing hell during the $150 March rally in an attempt to defend the cabal's fiat. If they hadn't gold would have gone up a lot more than $150.

Here's the procedure to guess who removed the metal: 

Since the metal is in JP Morgan's vault, I looked at all the gold sold by JP Morgan and its customer accounts only. Scrolling back through time, those entities sold 320,000 oz or 3.82 tonne from March 31 onward ... not enough to source today's vault departure.

In other words, if this is metal was bought recently, it would have to include part of the 33.2 tonne sold by JP Morgan's house account on March 30. 

That's extremely interesting. That was an epic sale by JP Morgan. It was the largest sale ever for them, and now it may be involved in metal moving out of comex.

Next, I looked at who stopped (bought) that 33.2 tonne JP Morgan sold on March 30. While you typically don't know which short's metal went to which long, in this case JP Morgan accounted for 63% of the gold sold that day, so you can guess that the big buyers that day got a sizable piece of JP Morgan's metal.

Below are the players who stopped more than one tonne that day. The primary suspects from this list are BofA, Citi and Morgan Stanley customer accounts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvybhgpmmv1b1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ce5df2dab1943e86ebd5c9cda8807312bc168b

Next I looked at all the ***net*** metal stopped since March 30 by all comex players. This would be from any and all sellers. See the list below. Note that some of this metal may have been acquired from non-JP Morgan sellers, but it would be near impossible to screen further to who stopped metal from only JP Morgan's vault.

https://preview.redd.it/exdzw80fnv1b1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=56832df2c8b05b5875e7984557805b7f5a5634d2

Note that Citi isn't on the list as they sold all of the metal bought on March 30 (plus another 5%). So Citi is off the suspect list and the list is down to 2.

Morgan Stanley customers acquired 8.1 tonne on March 30 and another 1.8 tonne after March 30. Their accrued net purchase since March 30 is 9.9 tonne. It IS possible that they moved their newly bought 9.9 tonne plus another 4.8 tonne they had bought previously, but this is less likely. Furthermore, this all assumes that Morgan Stanley customers are all acting together, or are (mostly) one entity.  I think they are a long shot.

That leaves BofA. What about them?

BofA stopped 13.6 tonne on March 30 and another 16.9 tonne since for a total of 30.5 tonne. Furthermore, they haven't sold **any** gold at all over the last 4 months which is an indication of the direction of their intent ... not flipping metal. The accumulated gold bought since March 30 far surpasses today's vault move of 14.7 tonne. They are the lead suspect.

Who'dve thunk. It wasn't Putin or Xi after all.

The possibility that one of comex's biggest gold players is buying metal and removing it from (at least) registered, is significant. BofA has bought a net 125 tonne since becoming active in early 2021. If this 14.7 tonne is their metal, that would be 12% of their stack.  And maybe more is going out!

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Silver Vaults

JP Morgan did NOT move a truckload into the vaults today, unlike the prior 7 days. Perhaps their silver stack rebuild is complete at 4.2 million oz. If so, that is nothing like the volumes they could effortlessly deliver with the click of the mouse, like 30 million oz at a time. That was before they were downgraded to jay pee pee.

A net 340,000 oz is out of the vault and 400,000 oz was moved out of registered at JP Morgan's vault. BofA?

The June inactive month silver contract is counting down to first notice day with 5 (biz) days to go. The OI has stabilized at 1,133 contracts or about 5.5 million oz. Just noticing that the SIL contract (the 1,000 oz micro) has about 1.2 million oz ready to stand for delivery too.

Back to just the SI contract ... while that OI plots as near the average of prior contracts (shown below on the countdown plot), it is much greater than recent months.

Plus, as a fraction of registered silver, it's one of the highest months over the last 3 years. At the current OI, it accounts for 18.5% of registered whereas the average inactive month (at day 5) is 7.3%:

Gold contracts continue to close with the total OI declining 6,192 contracts. Based on recent price activity, you'd assume this is being driven by longs closing contracts.

Based on the June countdown plot, it would appear that of the roll pair contracts (June and August) most of the reduction is in the August contract. I say that because the June contract is 16,000 below the mean, whereas the sum of the two is 39,000 below the mean. The June contract OI is as follows:

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver Vaults

For the 7th day in a row a truckload was received at JP Morgan's vault. If you've not yet been enlightened, a truckload in my jargon is 600,000 oz. A lot of comex silver moves in lots of 600k. That is also a typical payload that can be moved by most class 8 trucks in the USA. Converted to lbs that is 41,000. And for you people that haven't yet converted, that is 18,800 kilos.

So that is now 4.2 million oz of newly arrived metal at JP Morgan's vault over the last 7 days. This is not unlike JP Morgan's restocking of 30 tonne of gold with 6 deposits between March 31 and May 2.

Today, however, the 600k oz deposit at JP Morgan was offset by a 1.1 million oz move out of the vault. Furthermore, 35,000 oz was transferred out of registered at JP Morgan's vault.

For the totals of all 10 comex vaults,  600k was moved in, 2.5 million oz was moved out for a net decline of 1.9 million oz. Also 280,000 oz was moved out of registered to eligible.

JP Morgan,Another 7.5 tonne of gold moved out of JP Morgan's registered vault brings the 3 day total to 25.9 tonne and zeros out the entirety of comex 400 oz registered gold.,"Another 7.5 tonne of gold moved out of JP Morgan's registered vault brings the 3 day total to 25.9 tonne and zeros out the entirety of comex 400 oz registered gold. The comex gold contracts had another large reduction in open interest dropping by 10,886 contracts. Give it a yawn. That is typical for this point in the cycle (2 days to first notice).  Basically, there are a lot of folks who hang around with about 5 or 6 days to go who are not hedgers. They are arbs or folks trying to pick up some fiat as the herd rolls or closes. They just close without rolling.

The raw numbers:

That 10,886 decline drops the OI well below the pre-OI surge level from about 3 weeks ago:

https://preview.redd.it/xjbmrdinq92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6adea51f149847d74ad0d99d96b7581023a865f

Currently we are in the last days of the roll period from the June contract to the August contract. See the OI countdown plot below. The number of contracts that closed on the June contract was 42,498 which is exactly the average.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8xkqppht92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=aced6c293570491b5b3faa1f8cb908fc879e22ac

What happened, and almost always happens at this point, is that many of those contracts didn't roll to August. They just closed. The new August contracts totaled 31,219 or 11,279 less. However, this 11,279 is routine for day 2. In fact usually it is even greater at 14,500.

&#x200B;

The June contract OI is now 58% of registered metal in the vault:

https://preview.redd.it/wr5tgow8t92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e979180681727b76d38dc43ce874581637c24fb

Moving on the the gold vaults ...  the story at JP Morgan's vault is more bizarre. There was an additional 242,611 oz (or 7.5 tonne) moved out of JP Morgan's vault. This time the move was from the 400 oz vault.

You may recall the March 2020 near crack up at comex. In an effort to add physical supply, comex changed its rules such that contracts could be settled with 400 oz bars in addition the the usual 100 oz bars. An additional category was added to the vault report specifically for the 400 oz bars.

Considering all of comex (not just JP Morgan), as of yesterday's report only 242,611 oz or 2% of comex registered gold consisted of 400 oz bars. That gives some indication of how many settlements consist of 400 oz bars. Eligible gold consisted of 3,895,686 oz (or 35%) in 400 oz bars.

Therefore, this 242,611 oz move from registered to eligible zeros out comex registered in the 400 oz bar category.

&#x200B;

Was that 242,611 oz move on today's report also BofA?   Over the two prior days BofA (at least it is a high probability it was BofA) moved 18.3 tonne out of JP Morgan's registered (in the 100 oz vault). I'd bet that it was BofA which would bring their 3 day move out of registered to 25.9 tonne.

Moving on to other vault changes ... there was also a 250,778 oz (7.8 tonne) move *into* registered at JP Morgan's vault.

Since that is all getting complicated, I'll cut and paste the raw report for the JP Morgan portion of the vault report:

&#x200B;

I doubt that BofA is moving metal out of, and then back into, registered. So I don't think this is connected to the discussion above. I suspect that we will see someone issue 2,510 contracts early next week.  I'll wait until then to see who's name is printed on the issues and stops report. I have a premonition who that may be.

&#x200B;

Other vault moves ... one tonne into MTB's vault. And the net of all that is ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver

First notice day on the June inactive silver contract is also Monday. FYI ... FND of gold and silver contracts are always synced. The June silver open interest continues flat at 1,114 contracts or 5.57 million oz. Another 1.34 million oz is about to stand for delivery on the micro contract for a total of 6.91 million oz. That'll require 23% of the registered silver.

Speaking of the vault, registered dropped below 30 million oz again. 600 k is out of registered at MTB and 300 k out at HSBC.

The new vault, Asahi, showed 600 k oz arriving with a small offset of 55 k oz departing. The net of all that is ...

Another big day at the gold vaults. There was followup from yesterday's huge move with an additional 118,000 oz or 3.7 tonne moving out of registered at JP Morgan's vault. That is on top of yesterday's 471,000 oz or 14.7 tonne bringing the 2 day total to 18.3 tonne. 

So far, none of that metal has left the vault ... according to the vault reports.

In yesterday's piece, I showed analysis that points the finger at BofA for being the responsible party. You gotta read daily as I can't keep a post concise and repeat the relevant history: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147\_tonne\_vacates\_jp\_morgans\_comex\_gold\_vault/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147_tonne_vacates_jp_morgans_comex_gold_vault/)

These new vault withdrawal numbers are completely consistent with my BofA guess. In fact, strengthens the BofA case because the alternatives had bought much less than BofA recently. Yesterday I mentioned that there is a lot more where that came from ... and there still is.

Separately, there was a 7.0 tonne deposit at Malca Amit's vault. That is a 35% increase. I don't have any recon on who that could be, but I suspect their name will be on the issues and stops report on Monday.

The upcoming June gold contract is an active month and with first notice day on Monday. The OI trajectory has been declining less than usual the last few days as you can see in the plot below.

Usually the number of contracts standing for delivery ranges from 10-20%. Apparently the gold vaults are managed with more cushion than the silver vaults. Why? Probably because a delivery miss on gold would be game over.

&#x200B;

The daily change in OI of the front month contract is shown below. It's the derivative of the plot above. Note that today's trading, day 2 before first notice day, usually has the largest decline in OI.

As the June contract appears at the average (bold black line) on the first plot, when adjusted for the reduction in registered gold, the OI is one of the higher contracts. The June contract has 95% of registered gold compared to the average of 75%.

The OI on the June silver contract, an inactive month, is holding around 1,120 contracts. Traders generally don't roll on inactive month contracts which is why the OI isn't plunging like the active month gold contract.

The silver vaults saw 532 koz arrive, mostly at HSBC's vault and 1,087 koz depart mostly at Delaware Depository and HSBC's vaults. The net is 555 koz OUT OF THE VAULT. No change in registered.

JP Morgan,Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank,"Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are helping the Ukrainian government set up a reconstruction bank to steer public seed capital into rebuilding projects that can attract hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment.

The Ukraine Development Fund remains in the planning stages and is not expected to fully launch until the end of hostilities with Russia. But investors will have a preview this week at a London conference co-hosted by the British and Ukrainian governments.

“So many of today’s long-term challenges are best addressed through blended finance and this is one. You need these vehicles to mobilise capital at scale,” said BlackRock vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand, who will be discussing the work on Wednesday.

The World Bank estimated in March that Ukraine would need $411bn to rebuild after the war, and recent Russian attacks have driven that figure higher.

The Kyiv government engaged BlackRock’s consulting arm in November to determine how best to attract that kind of capital, and then added JPMorgan in February. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced last month that the country was working with the two financial groups and consultants at McKinsey.

No formal fundraising target has been set but people familiar with the discussions say the fund is seeking to raise low-cost capital from governments, donors and international financial institutions and leverage it to attract between five and 10 times as much private investment.

BlackRock and JPMorgan are donating their services, although the work will give them an early look at possible investments in the country. The assignment also deepens JPMorgan’s relationship with a longstanding client. The bank has helped Ukraine raise more than $25bn in sovereign debt since 2010 and led the country’s $20bn debt restructuring last year.

The financiers consulted with private and public sector investors and found they wanted to help Ukraine but were leery not just about war losses but also the country’s governance, lack of transparency and shallow capital markets.

What Ukraine needed, BlackRock advised, was a development finance bank to find investment opportunities in sectors such as infrastructure, climate and agriculture and make them attractive to pension funds and other long-term investors and lenders. JPMorgan was brought in partly for its debt expertise.

“The fund is being set up to also give public and private sector investors the opportunity to invest into specific projects and sectors,” said Stefan Weiler, JPMorgan’s head of debt capital markets for central Europe, Middle East and Africa. “There will be different sectoral funds that the fund identified as priorities for Ukraine. The aim is maximise capital participation.”

The structure calls for the fund to use the lower-cost public money, known as concessional capital, to make initial investments and absorb the first losses.

The notion is that this initial seed capital would be a de-risking mechanism, and it would create the potential for private sector capital to come in at scale,” said Brandon Hall, co-head of BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory arm. “Ukraine will have its own organisation to source and syndicate these local investment opportunities.”

To overcome investor concerns about governance, the fund is expected to stock its board with representatives of international financial institutions and governments and hire investment professionals to execute its strategy.

“Our view is that if you have a strong governance structure and an internationally credible set of stakeholders who are in the leadership position in this fund, then that will go a long way,” Hall said",0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,https://on.ft.com/443yCpg,06/20/2023,06:27:00,DoYouWant_the_Cheese,21,Europe

JP Morgan is almost certainly restocking the silver vault with a third day in a row of a truckload deposit. Plus Degen ""erisorto"" wins the prize. Yesterday I was writing about the roll period where traders close their position on an upcoming active month contract and open a position in the next active month contract. A high fraction of contracts roll forward as such.

Furthermore, near the start of the roll period, there is a large increase in the number of TAS contracts on both the outgoing and incoming contracts. Basically, traders often utilize the trade at settlement (TAS) alternative to close and/or open their positions.

Below is a plot of the TAS volume for each contract. Focus on the pink shaded ""outgoing"" TAS period around day 17 to 8 days to first notice.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e985osbjvf0b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a39de36f63f00125720a7e6396fde1f07c0a327

It's not readily apparent on the above plot, but the TAS surge almost always lasts 5 continuous business days. Furthermore, it never starts on a Wednesday.

The question I asked was ... why doesn't the TAS surge start on Wednesdays?

FYI ... below are the stats on the start of the 5 day surge:

https://preview.redd.it/vzdenod4wf0b1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e04b0042f57f51528efc32e2f2f9e4b1253d7b

Of the 12,500 degenerates who read yesterday's post, only 1 person figured that out.

Aaaand the winner is ""erisorto"" of the SilverDegenClub:

https://preview.redd.it/ff9an4ydwf0b1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=427333350efa3556ba4ff6f365e2ae08816323f1

To add some commentary to erisorto's comments ...  a couple of months back, the sum total of the 5 day TAS surge was a lot less than usual. I thought I could then look at the CoT and see which category of trader had declined by comparing two subsequent CoT reports. If there was some correlation, that could infer which type of trader exploits TAS during those 5 days.

I then realized that that particular 5 day TAS period spanned 2 CoT reports. That fuzzes up the numbers because you then have to look at three subsequent reports to determine the changes.  It fuzzed things up enough that it wasn't apparent which category was involved.

I looked back through time and ALL of the TAS surge numbers spanned 2 reports. What a coincidink!

FYI ... the CoT report is based on traders position at the end of trading on Tuesday (and posted on Friday). The only way to get a clean week to week change between just 2 reports would be if the TAS surge started on a Wednesday. And that's why it never starts on Wednesday!

Everyone will want to start pointing fingers at the CME folks. However, note that the exchange has no rules or guidance about when to roll, or whether to use TAS or not. It's the traders themselves who decide. Apparently, the vast majority of traders decide to not roll their own position on Wednesdays. Furthermore, they mostly avoid Tuesday and Thursday because that splits the change at a 4:1 ratio (or 1:4). By rolling on Monday or Friday, the change is split by a 3:2 (or 2:3) for maximum obfuscation and that is what they do 75% of the time.

The traders are obfuscating data about themselves. The core driver of this is the weekly schedule of the CoT report with positions reported from the Tuesday close. It would be interesting to see if the CFTC required traders to report, say, twice a week. Would the traders modify their 5 day TAS surge?

Congrats to erisorto.  Comex traders have been parading him around the comex pits all day. He's got an interview on CNBC set for tomorrow morning at the opening bell, plus a visit to the White House later in the week.

And on with the new stuff:

Yesterday I wrote about the gold open interest surging ahead by 14,416 contracts on Monday and how that invited a (price) beat down. Although, when I wrote that, the beat down was in progress (on Tuesday). What I didn't know was the beat down reversed that entire OI increase, dropping OI by 14,189 contracts.

One of the larger OI increases immediately followed by one of the larger reductions:

What happened with silver? The Tuesday smack down did drive a few longs out of the May silver contract ... just 22 contracts. But a near offsetting number (18) opened June contracts as you can see below. This may seem like small potatoes but between the tail of the May contract and the upcoming June contract,  7-1/2 million oz will need delivered shortly. The June contract is an inactive month and typically all of those dudes hang around for delivery.

The shorts on the May contract continue to not deliver metal ... zero delivery notices last night. Eight days left to deliver.

JP Morgan analysts have made some predictions, stating that Washington may feel obligated to take additional measures in response to recent events. These measures could potentially include an emergency stop to short-selling, expanding deposit insurance to prevent bank runs, or even limiting the type of information that can be disseminated on social media.

# The firm’s market access controls failed to prevent five erroneous orders routed to exchanges and alternative trading systems:

* On January 30, 2019, a firm trader on the Program Trading Agency Desk routed to the market an order to purchase 50,000 shares of an equity security. 
   * The trader intended to enter a limit price of $268.50, but mistakenly input $286.50. 
   * The firm received executions with prices over 5% higher than the last execution in the market prior to entry of this order. 
   * The firm submitted clearly erroneous filings and approximately half of the 50,000-share order (executions above $276.57) were busted. 
* On July 26, 2019, a client entered a market order to sell 86,500 equity shares instead of the intended limit order. 
   * A trader accepted the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The last share price at the time of order entry was $27.23. 
   * The firm received executions at prices down to $22.25, representing an approximately 18% drop. 
* On December 19, 2019, instead of entering a limit-on-close order, a firm trader on the Equity Finance Trading Desk erroneously entered a limit order to buy 230,000 shares of an equity security at $154.17. 
   * The firm routed the order to the market and received executions with prices up to $154.17, which was approximately 3% higher than the prior execution price at order entry of $149.52. 
   * The firm filed a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $154.01 were busted. 
* On March 26, 2020, a client entered a pairs order in the firm’s system. 
   * While a firm algorithm was handling the order, a control paused the order for manual review. 
   * After the review and the resumption of the order, the algorithm handling the order did not refresh the market data to account for the pause. 
   * In less than one minute, the system routed to various execution venues over 80,000 immediate-or-cancel orders, which the execution venues canceled back unfilled because they were priced away from the prevailing market. 
* On April 22, 2021, a client entered a market order to buy 4,765 equity shares but intended to buy 50 shares at a limit price of $4,765. 
   * The Electronic Client Solutions Desk received the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The firm received executions with prices up to $5,077.30, which was approximately 6% higher than the last traded price of $4,799.99. 
   * The firm submitted a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $4,903.50 were busted. 

# The firm’s erroneous order and duplicative order controls were not reasonably designed:  

* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied fixed single order quantity limits ranging from 100,000 to 9,999,999 shares depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client involved in each order. 
   * The firm also applied static single order notional value limits ranging from $25,000,000 to $500,000,000 depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client. Each of these single order quantity and single order notional value limits applied static limits regardless of security and thus failed to consider the individual characteristics of the security. 
   * The firm further applied average daily volume limits ranging from 25 to 50 percent based on the specific desk, trader, and/or client.
   *  With the exception of one desk’s single order quantity control, the firm’s single order quantity, single order notional value, and average daily value thresholds were too large to be effective, and the firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set them at such levels.
* Moreover, many of the above referenced size controls triggered “soft blocks” when applicable thresholds were reached. 
   * In contrast to a “hard block,” which generally prevents an order from being submitted by automatically rejecting it, a soft block pauses an order until the block is overridden or the order is cancelled back or modified. 
      * For most of the relevant period, however, the firm’s written supervisory procedures did not address how to handle, document, and review soft block overrides. 
      * Accordingly, the firm’s controls that relied on soft blocks did not prevent the entry of certain erroneous orders. 
      * By January 2021, the firm implemented changes to its supervisory requirements relating to soft blocks that included tracking and reviews of soft block overrides and adding compliance trainings and updates to its written supervisory procedures on the handling of soft blocks.
* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied single order limit price controls based on fixed percentages away from the National Best Bid and Offer, ranging from three to 15 percent depending on the desk, trader, and/or client involved. 
   * Like the firm’s size controls, certain limit price thresholds were set too high to be effective. 
   * In particular, the limit price controls generally exceeded the numerical guidelines for clearly erroneous transactions. 
   * The firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set its limit price thresholds at levels greater than the definition of a clearly erroneous transaction. 
      * Additionally, for the same reasons previously noted above, the firm’s supervisory system for soft blocks was deficient for most of the relevant period. 
      * In October 2020, the firm began introducing a price control that applied different thresholds to differently priced securities.  
* Furthermore, the firm did not have a reasonable duplicative order control. 
   * The firm did apply a risk control that checked orders with the same symbol, side, and quantity. 
   * This control triggered a hard block if more than 50,000 order messages with the same symbol, side, and quantity were sent within two seconds. 
   * However, the 50,000-order threshold, which was applied separately to each of the firm’s connections to external venues, was too high to be effective. 
   * The firm provided no documented rationale supporting why such a high threshold was reasonable. 

As of July 2022, the firm had implemented additional controls to prevent the entry of orders that—based on price and/or size of the order relative to the market—could potentially lead to unintended market impact.

>Yet, in addition to close associates of Wexner, Dimon’s coronation as one of the most powerful bankers in the country was also made possible thanks to another powerful clan that also shares close connections to Wexner – the Crown family of Chicago. Perhaps even more than Wexner, the Crowns are a testament to how the worlds of organized crime and corporate power have mixed over the years to produce elites who are truly untouchable. With a long-standing dominant role in the American military-industrial complex as well as other facets of the corporate world, the Crowns have a history of doing what’s necessary – whether legal or illegal – to get what they want to advance their political agendas and grow their own power. Even presidents and the Pentagon have been unable to successfully challenge them. As this article will show, the Crowns – perhaps more than any other group – are a critical part of the story of how Jame Dimon became the king of Wall Street.

Plus, JP Morgan has now nearly restocked its gold vault after dumping 33.5 tonne of gold $200 ago. That's the ""smart"" money! After a huge 3 day surge followed by a one day drop, the total gold contract open interest has settled into normalcy. The June contract is now a few days into the roll period as that contract's OI is falling and the roll month of August is increasing.

Typically there is a total OI increase during this portion of the roll, so today's total OI increase of 3,166 is normal compared to the average of 3,570. You can see the OI cycle below where the solid black line is the arithmetic average:

Isolating the June and August contracts shows the same impact:

Meanwhile back at the May contract which is currently in the delivery period, 218 net new gold contracts were written on Tuesday.  There's still plenty of time left, so call your broker and buy a few gold bars for near immediate delivery.

&#x200B;

The issues and stops report shows mostly JP Morgan customers selling gold to other JP Morgan customers. The big players that were very active earlier in the month, BofA and Citi, have ceased activity for now.

&#x200B;

Let's talk silver!

The upcoming June contract's OI has increased to 981, or about 4.9 million oz, and is much higher than recent months. This is an inactive month and typically, these contracts stay open and take delivery. You can see that in the flat bold black average line which stays mostly flat during the run up to first notice day. That's in sharp contrast to the active months where OI is plunging toward FND. Real men buy inactive months ... apparently.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yenuix4h72za1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2af0c7b0eb96f44fea26ccb8a51311862c17bd9f

That 4.9 million oz is 18% of registered vault totals. If you think of it relative to the registered vault total, suddenly the June contract OI is almost twice the average inactive month. See the plot below.

Perhaps that's why some silver is arriving at the vaults lately.

Speaking of the silver vaults, after increasing for each of the last 3 days, 220,000 oz departed the vaults:

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Gold Vaults

The gold vaults saw 55,000 oz arrive at JP Morgan's vault. There have been six 160,000 oz deposits over the last 28 business days. Perhaps today's report is the final installment of JP Morgan's gold rebuild as this brings the recent total deposited to 31.7 tonnes. Recall that they sold 33.5 tonnes on the April contract as they apparently defended the cabal's fiat during the March gold rally.

JP Morgan,"We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan?","We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan? Microstrategy has an insane plan. It's wildly complex and super intricate. After much analysis I have concluded the following:

When BTC goes up, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC goes down, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC crabs, MS buys Bitcoin

When Michael Saylor is sued, MS buys Bitcoin

It may be a bit hard to follow but I can dumb in down for you: MS buys Bitcoin.

I even made a joke of it here, and I think we generally view MS as on 'our side' but MS currently owns around 140,000 BTC which is about 0.72% of circulating supply. It's doesn't sound like *that* much but it's pretty close to close to an entire 1%. In fact, it's almost certain that they will own more than 1% of the total supply at the end of all this. And that percentage is deceiving because we don't know how many BTC is permanently burned, but it's likely quite a lot, so the actual percentage they'll own will be even greater. Chainalysis estimates that up to 20% of the Bitcoin already issued may be permanently lost, which means they own more like 0.9% of what's left.

To put their buys into perspective, in just 2 years since March 2021, they managed to purchase 0.25% of circulating supply. Estimates have put the final Bitcoin to be mined in 2140. Of course, most of us won't be alive, but if MS continues at current rates, they'll have another 2.5% of supply in just 10 years. This is a hard estimate as their are many factors to this but it's fair enough I think. Imagine how much they'll earn in 30 years alone, when we would have all grown old(er).

I don't think we'll look at then the way we do now.",0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12fz6jg/we_encourage_and_laugh_with_microstrategy_now_but/,04/09/2023,02:35:43,OneThatNoseOne,324,Europe

JP Morgan,JP Morgan Chase earnings report,"JP Morgan Chase earnings report The 2023 Q2 earnings report for JPMorgan Chase has just been released. Overall, the ER is a remarkable demonstration of the durability and power of the top bank. JPM's results, both top and bottom line, exceeded market forecasts. The fact that the bank declared a solid balance sheet during and after a highly tumultuous time for the banking industry is, in my opinion, more significant.   
The last one or two quarters have been described by certain media as the most difficult for banks since the 2008 crisis. JPM was able to keep a healthy standardised CET1 capital ratio of 13.8% even after the First Republic deal. J.P. Morgan was able to negotiate a favourable price because they were the only reliable buyer for FRC. In a back-of-the-envelope analysis of the transaction, Matt Levine of Bloomberg noted how J.P. Morgan receives good upside and regulatory protection while sharing a large portion of the potential losses if the loans default. Although the estimated $500 million in annual net income for the agreement is small in comparison to the $40 billion or so they already generate, it demonstrates that a bank like JPMorgan can take advantage of the crisis.  
The bank currently has $1.4 trillion in cash and short-term securities, which is a lot of liquidity. I have no doubt that JPM will be able to fulfil these new standards and keep its fortress balance sheet, even though there may be some capital changes and liquidity in the near future as the banking industry adapts to new rules.  
Given the current instability in the banking industry, regulatory standards may be modified in various ways. With Basel III's completion, Dimon himself anticipates ""material changes"" to capital and liquidity. He continued by issuing a warning that the market as a whole as well as end customers would probably be affected by these regulatory changes in the real world.

JP Morgan,Registered silver continues to drain with another truckload out of registered at Brinks. JP Morgan's gold vault sees 5 tonne hasta la vaulta. That is 3% of their vault total.,"Registered silver continues to drain with another truckload out of registered at Brinks. JP Morgan's gold vault sees 5 tonne hasta la vaulta. That is 3% of their vault total. &#x200B;

Following up from last week's analysis, the July contract continues adding net new contracts for immediate delivery. Friday saw 32 move contracts tacked on or 160,000 koz. The cumulative after 5 days is 402 contracts or 2.01 million oz or 5.8% of registered silver.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syii3vhe17bb1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd535a20564b936aed1d04018e6614108bf1eb1

At the silver vaults one even truckload was removed from Brinks' vault. That is 3 days in a row where one even truckload was moved out of registered. I'd surmise that this party is whoever bought part of the 12 million oz sold by Standard Chartered (and delivered out of Brinks' vault). Only 3 parties were issued more than 1.8 million oz that day ...

&#x200B;

* JP Morgan customer accounts -    6.070 million oz
* BofA                                                   2.565 million oz
* Morgan Stanley house account - 2.225 million oz.

Time may tell, or at least indicate, who is moving metal out of registered. It all 12 million oz moves out, that'd be 17 more truckloads.  And, for the record, I'm not predicting that.

&#x200B;

I thought it was odd that silver was moving out of registered in 600 koz batches even thought it hasn't (yet) moved out of the vault. I've documented that silver moves in or out of the vault in 600 koz tranches, but moves from registered to eligible or versa vice could be different.

I don't know if vaults segregate registered from eligible. If it was just a digital reassignment, you'd think they could change status of any amount of silver with just a click the mouse. If they actually move the metal, there could be size considerations to change status.

Curiosity got the best of me and I did the stats. Moves in and out of registered ARE more frequent than most other size moves except small moves (-250,000 to +50,000).  See the histogram below.

And those are thousands of oz on the x-axis:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7cctiwwh67bb1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d58f74518c3bbdb4fbf4f17158bc07e26f69cb5

But if you consider the percentage of total oz moved, the truckload size change jumps out:

https://preview.redd.it/sc55raxna7bb1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd21a233c2f840bda40cd4f36d7bd5a552f571e

It's possible that there are moves into or out of registered in 600 koz lots only because it arrives or departs the vaults in those sizes. I'm saying that because often silver moves in or out of the vault occur before or soon after the change from registered. To get to the bottom of that, I'd have to strip out moves that weren't associated with a move in or out of the vault. Ain't doing that right now. Maybe someday.

At the end of all that ... I don't know why these 3 Brinks' moves have been 3 sequential 600 koz changes and the metal remains in eligible.

MTB also moved 100 koz out of registered:

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold Vaults

JP Morgan's vault sees 5 even tonne (160 koz) moved out of the vault. That is 3.1% of that vaults total silver. Depository Services of Delaware also sees 12 koz depart.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ckuiqiqjd7bb1.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=33c4e5a7b7b87b223605261a187caaf2e4bd6cfe

The JP Morgan withdrawal isn't connected to any recent moves from registered. The last move exceeding 5 tonne from JP Morgan's registered was May 23, or 34 biz days ago.

Perhaps their recent gold vault build will be reversed:

JP Morgan,"JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz.","JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz. The total of JP Morgan's vault of registered silver has dwindled from over 40 million oz at the start of the silver squeeze to 8.1 million oz.

The JP Morgan vault would be the total of JP Morgan, the bank's silver, and customer silver. Typically JP Morgan's house account doesn't keep much silver in registered so this move out today is likely silver owned by customer accounts.

A couple of weeks ago I had written that I identified BofA as removing vast quantities of gold, 25.9 tonne, from registered at JP Morgan's vault.  This could be BofA's silver.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another\_75\_tonne\_of\_gold\_moved\_out\_of\_jp\_morgans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another_75_tonne_of_gold_moved_out_of_jp_morgans/)

&#x200B;

JP Morgan's eligible metal stands at 133.3 million oz. From that, deduct the 103 million oz that is ""owned"" by SLV's authorized participants (and probably a few other parties) which leaves 30.3 million oz. Again, that would be the total of customer and the bank's silver.

I had documented the occasions where it became apparent that the JP Morgan, the bank, was out of silver during 2022 although they have likely restocked to some extent. I always pay special attention to JP Morgan as they are the cabal's lead banker.

Today's comex total of 27.3 million oz is a 6.5 year low last seen in December 29, 2016.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold Vaults

There was a large move out of the gold vaults at JP Morgan's vaults, 221 koz or 6.86 tonne. That's 2.5% of JP Morgan's vault total and 1% of comex total.

A couple of weeks ago I documented huge moves at JP Morgan's gold vault as metal  moved out of registered. Now it appears that it is going out of the vault.

On May 23 and 24 there were 589 koz or 18.3 tonne moved out of registered. I posted an analysis that showed that the likely perp was almost certainly BofA. They are the only party that has net stopped that much gold, specifically 30.5 tonne since March 30 of this year and 124 tonne over the last 2-1/2 years.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147\_tonne\_vacates\_jp\_morgans\_comex\_gold\_vault/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147_tonne_vacates_jp_morgans_comex_gold_vault/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13rrxjy/the\_2\_day\_departure\_of\_gold\_out\_of\_jp\_morgans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13rrxjy/the_2_day_departure_of_gold_out_of_jp_morgans/)

Since those moves out of registered, JP Morgan's gold vault has been fairly quiet. It isn't a certainty that this is BofA's gold that was 1) recently bought at comex and 2) moved out of registered and 3) now moved out of the vault. But it is likely. 

If it is BofA's gold, this 6.86 tonne would represent 38% of the that 18.3 tonne moved out of registered on May 23 and 23. We may get some clarity in the days ahead if there is a follow up move(s) out of the vault.

Why care? BofA has been a huge buyer of gold at comex over the last 2-1/2 years. They have bought a net 4.0 million oz (124 tonne). IF (notice that is in uppercase), all of that was in JP Morgan's vault, that would represent 80% of the JP Morgan vault total. Yesterday's move of 6.86 tonne is only 6% of BofA's net stopped gold. How's that for an avalanche waiting to fall?

The numbers to the oz:

A truckload (640 koz) was deposited at Loomis' vault and a half truckload departed Brinks for a net increase of 361 koz:

No change in registered, and even with 6 continuous days of no change in registered. That is no big deal.

I hear that yesterday one of my (blocked) trolls on Twitter is making a deal about there being 5 days of no change in registered silver. BFD. In fact, it is the 4th time **this year** that has occurred.  Even after yesterday's 6th day in a row of no change, a continuous 6 day span has happened **3 times this year**.

It's still about 10 days too early to look at the countdown to first notice on the July silver contract, however I can't help but notice that the OI decline is less than average:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atgitobcd16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e3d70dae95e6edc754db1b3bb6e117997dcade

This next plot is the daily change in OI ... essentially the derivative of the plot above. Note that the daily decline is running a couple of thousand contracts per day below average.

https://preview.redd.it/9cxkl8tdd16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=f30b6ba11498d193f4569daba0f8ba705a96491e

Meanwhile traders are flooding into the September contract causing a surge in total OI. See the plot below.

Note the blue line for the May 23 contract also experienced an OI surge at this point in the cycle. I'll have to think about why they are mirroring each other.

https://preview.redd.it/8fxlgoi1g16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45b37db55b061074291ccbba31deea21f3235e4

Yesterday the OI increase for the September contract (7,296) was more than double the decline for July (3,167). Usually, during the core of the roll, these are offsetting. The total OI increase is 4,382.

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    comex vaults

Yesterday was ""take it away Tuesday"" at the comex vaults. One truckload (600 koz) departed JP Morgan and Loomis' vaults, 476 koz was out of Delaware Depository and 100 koz was out of CNT. All of that was somewhat offset by a 487 koz deposit at JP Morgan and 300 koz at Brinks.

The net change was 978 koz OUT OF THE VAULT:

https://preview.redd.it/ht16uy1nh16b1.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=a01f6d1361ea8579346c19f2e7841b9f18279476

&#x200B;

But that was nothing compared to gold.  Brinks' gold vault saw a 162 koz or 5.0 tonne departure. That is 3.4% of Brinks' vault total.

Scrolling back in time, Brinks had a 367 koz move out of registered on May 30, just a couple of weeks ago. That date was first notice day on the June contract so I have to try to pair that move with a gold buyer. However, nobody stopped that much gold, so I can't point the finger at anyone specifically. The largest buyer(s) that day were JP Morgan customer accounts at 353 koz ... fairly close. It is possible the vault move was JP Morgan customer account gold.

Here was the detail from that day:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely\_odd\_day\_for\_comex\_silver\_all\_just\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely_odd_day_for_comex_silver_all_just_to/)

Here we are 10 biz days later and 162 koz moves out of the vault. It's logical to connect those, although that is not certain. Perhaps that 5 tonne will show up at JP Morgan's vault or perhaps another large comex player is buying gold at comex, moving it out of registered and then OUT OF THE VAULT.

Asahi, the new vault, showed a 48 koz deposit.

JP Morgan,"Did JP Morgan Chase just get a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout to make it a bigger systemic risk so that the global financial system must bail them out?","Did JP Morgan Chase just get a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout to make it a bigger systemic risk so that the global financial system must bail them out? According to the list of global systemically important banks ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_systemically_important_banks), [Financial Stability Board (FSB)](https://www.fsb.org/2022/11/2022-list-of-global-systemically-important-banks-g-sibs/), [FSB PDF](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P211122.pdf)), JP Morgan Chase is top dog as the *only Tier 4* bank.  (The higher the tier, the more systemic risk the bank poses to the financial system so the required capital buffer is higher at each tier.)

>A systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis). They are colloquially referred to as ""[**too big to fail**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail)"". \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution)\]

According to the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements), which has a [dashboard](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/) showing scores and components for Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs), JP Morgan Chase is by itself in Tier 4 with the highest overall risk rating as the most interconnected bank with the most complex banking relationships.

***If*** **JP Morgan Chase were to fail, the financial system would be at high risk of a financial crisis.**  *Which means JPM Chase is in an interesting position because the global financial system is both incentivized to keep JPM from failing and, if an institution is to fail, putting the most complex and interconnected financial institution at risk* ***maximizes the likelihood of another bailout***.

Some of you may remember from 2 years ago (April 15, 2021) that JP Morgan sold $13B in bonds in the largest bank deal ever at the time ([SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt6bju/why_banks_randomly_decided_to_sell_billions_in/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/jpmorgan-to-sell-13-billion-of-bonds-in-largest-bank-sale-ever)) to raise money.  The next day, Bank of America takes the lead by selling $15B worth of bonds ([SuperStonk DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsioql/the_complete_bank_of_america_gamestop_dd/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/bofa-to-set-record-for-largest-bank-bond-sale-at-15-billion#xj4y7vzkg), April 16, 2021).

So if JP Morgan needed to raise some serious money *without getting a bailout*, buying another bank in a sweetheart deal seems like another way to juice up JP Morgan's balance sheet with some good PR. According to [CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/01/business/first-republic-purchase-hnk-intl/index.html),

>First Republic ... had assets of **$229.1 billion** as of April 13. As of the end of last year, it was the nation’s **14th-largest bank**, according to a ranking by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States with total global assets of **nearly $4 trillion** as of March 31.

Now that JP Morgan picked up First Republic, their total assets increases by about $229B (about 5.7%).  And, according to Reuters \[[Factbox](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-deal-collapsed-first-republic-explained-2023-05-01/)\], JP Morgan just got a pretty sweet deal with First Republic Bank:

* JPMorgan Chase will pay **$10.6 billion** to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC)
* Will **not** assume First Republic's corporate **debt** or preferred stock
* FDIC to provide [loss share agreements](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/) with respect to most acquired loans

So JP Morgan paid $10.6B to pick up $229B (less than 5c on the dollar), passes on the corporate debt, and shares losses with the FDIC so that:

* JPMorgan expects one-time gain of **$2.6 billion** post-tax at closing
* Estimated to add roughly **$500 million to net income** and be accretive to tangible book value per share

**That's a pretty damn good deal.**  Let's look more into what the FDIC says about [shared loss agreements (SLA)](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/jqe3z9ira9xa1.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=cefb80e4cb215985e0ac3c5836fe1c77316b7b7e)

The FDIC absorbs a portion of the loss on assets sold through resolving a failed bank ""sharing the loss with the purchaser of the failed bank"".  *Sounds like the FDIC just took one for the team.*

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/7qob3s6qb9xa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bfd02469344d43cef0f50540691e63c9c08b22a)

According to the FDIC, loss sharing is basically an 80/20 split (except for after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis when the split was 95/5, which has ended).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/alkxtvz6c9xa1.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d900e614b00abc103fb360936f421a708a047e2)

According to the FDIC, resolving a failed bank with loss sharing is supposed to be based on **the least costly option** (to the Deposit Insurance Fund).  (We've seen this least costly option come up in resolving bank failures before with the FDIC and Federal Reserve contemplating requiring Too Big To Fail banks sell destined-to-fail bonds to absorb losses and reduce payouts by the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund \[[SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/zdebh6/comment_against_the_federal_reserve_fdic_proposal/)\])

According to [Investopedia, JPMorgan To Pay FDIC $10.6 Billion For First Republic, This is What It Gets](https://www.investopedia.com/what-does-jpmorgan-get-in-first-republic-deal-7487296), resolving FRC bank failure will cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $13B.

>The FDIC will take a **$13 billion hit to its fund** and *provide $50 billion in financing*.

Wait, the **FDIC is providing $50B to finance JPM buying FRC?!**

https://preview.redd.it/4j4du9umk9xa1.png?width=3492&format=png&auto=webp&s=33069c143c5351f6b2e616e6c826fc543090e181

The FDIC loaned JP Morgan $50B to buy the failed First Republic bank for $10.6B.  $30B of that was used to repay a [rescue deal from March (last month)](https://www.investopedia.com/first-republic-s-usd30b-rescue-by-jp-morgan-citi-and-bank-of-america-7367932) backed by JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.  Which means JP Morgan gets their money back from the previous rescue *plus* an **extra $9.4B** out of this loan deal to buy $229B worth of assets from First Republic.

On top of that, JP Morgan splits losses with the FDIC 80/20 with the FDIC covering 80% of loan losses for the next 5-7 years (5 years for commercial loans and 7 years for residential mortgages).

**Imagine if a bank** ***loans you*** **$9,400 to buy a $229,000 house.**  No down payment.  Just ""here's $9,400 and the keys to that $229,000 house"". Oh, and the bank will cover 80% of the cost for anything that breaks in the house for the next 5-7 years.  *This is an insane deal.*

**Which truly makes one wonder if this is a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout for JP Morgan,** the *only* Tier 4 GSIB as the most interconnected bank with the most complex banking relationships and the highest overall systemic risk rating.

Are we going to see:

1. Fat bonuses at JP Morgan?
2. Followed by news about JP Morgan posing a systemic risk?
3. Followed by calls to bail out JP Morgan to save pensions?

This is exactly why anonymity and privacy is so important in crypto as a future of finance and potential TradFi and banking replacement/improvement, as well as the significance of decentralization 19 states have come out accusing JP Morgan of of closing accounts and discriminating against customers due to their political or religious beliefs. A letter to JP Morgan said ""the bank had canceled major organizations' checking accounts and  had asked screening questions focused on religion and politics before  reinstating them"" JPMorgan also allegedly declined a proposal on participation in a  survey for the Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index, which is meant to determine ""freedom of expression and freedom of religion or  belief as a standard part of doing business,"". JPMorgan had received a score of 15% for the index in 2022 which obviously shows their massive bias and give credibility to the claims.

It's significant enough that JP Morgan would randomly close accounts, and defenders would have said it's due to anti-money laundering politcies/bank secrecy act etc, absolutely ridiculous and makes their intentions clear when they ask questions that screen customers religious and political beliefs before customers have just a *chance* to get their accounts reinstated.

There's been a bit of a push and pull in crypto whereby some people disagree with the need to anonymity. I'd argue that these are privileged people who've had no issues with banks having their information, but they only had no issues because they had money, which the bank wanted. The government view of crypto regulation is definitely to peel back that anonymity as far back as they can. But this situation shows exaclly why anonymity is important, as it immediately solves problems of discrimination as well as safety of the individuals as well so as not to become target, either of societal or corporate discrimination, or criminals.

And crypto balances it very well with allowing *privacy* but not *confidentiality*. Privacy means a lack of direct intrusion into private or personal affairs, so an anonymous blockchain has privacy, but not confidentiality.  This as confidentiality deals more with a complete block of access to information like the government sealing documents and offering no access at all.

It also ties right back into decentralization, where no centralized entity has the power to deny access to services on the blockchain. We all know that power corrupts and JP Morgan has way too much of that. Instead we have a decentralized blockchain where it would take a (mostly) democratic process to deny access to services, and even then it's pretty rare.

JP Morgan,"Gold OI declines 11,345 contracts and has now given back most of the OI surge from 2 weeks ago. Plus JP Morgan adds another truckload for the 5th day in a row.","Gold OI declines 11,345 contracts and has now given back most of the OI surge from 2 weeks ago. Plus JP Morgan adds another truckload for the 5th day in a row. The upcoming inactive June silver contract's open interest continues to drift upwards despite the chaos on the gold contracts. It now stands at 1,120 contracts. Typically nearly all of the OI of these inactive month contracts stand for delivery. First notice day is in 7 days.

https://preview.redd.it/i2jsvm8o9u0b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=416b79e3fb992185b1478ed0ef595be4ed71ffb3

I've rarely mentioned the micro silver contract. The ticker is SIL and it is a 1,000 oz deliverable contract. A guy on twitter, [@EsScalping](https://twitter.com/EsScalping), pointed out that there is also an ""E-mini"" silver contract. That ticker is QI and is for 2,500 oz but is only financially settled. You can't get silver on QI so it'll never impact comex vault totals.

Back to the SIL 1,000 oz micro contract. I mentioned yesterday that what's been happening is the CME group is making a market in the SIL contract.

Essentially there are three fairly big buyers and no sellers. The CME folks buy metal on the 5,000 oz SI contract and sell it to those 3 players on the 1,000 oz SIL contract.

I should probably say, I'm referring to the physical market ... those that stand for delivery. There may be others trading paper contracts, but I can't identify them.  I'm addressing the names I see on the issues and stops report for physical metal.

The CME group has sold 21.44 million oz net since 2019 and those three customer accounts have bought 21.42 million oz. The cumulative net tally for each is as follows:

&#x200B;

There's been a few bubbas that have occasionally stopped contracts, but you can see it is round off.

When the CME folks buy metal at the SI contract, it is essentially like some combination of these 3 customer accounts buying it. The metal just passes through, usually the same day.

Below are plots of the issues, stops and net for 1) the CME group, and 2) the largest buyer, Advantage customer accounts. Note that Advantage has rarely sold any silver.

I've considered adding the two contracts (SI and SIL) together for my graphics. The only reason I haven't is that the reader will have a difficult time tracking the raw numbers from the report to the graphs. Personally, I like to do that when viewing plots to gain confidence in the data. For now, I haven't added them. Currently, some of the larger issues and stops from the SIL contract are greater than the smaller, inactive months, on the SI contract. So I may start adding them for plots in the future.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold

The gold open interest fell another 11,345 contracts and has now given back much of the OI surge that occurred 2 weeks ago:

The June active month is 7 days to first notice and has now fallen below the average:

Over lunch today I listened to a podcast that mentioned an increase in gold EFP (exchange for physical) volume. EFP's are a swap of a comex futures contract with a ""physical"" contract in London. Settlement by EFP rarely induces metal leaving London vaults.

As far as an EFP surge, I'm not seeing it. I track the cumulative EFP volume after zeroing the meter at day 44 (the start of the OI plateau). See the plot below. The June gold contract was riding the average line (the bold black line ) until recently and then drifted slightly below trend.

That said, the number of contracts that routinely vacate comex by EFP is huge. Usually it exceeds the total gold in registered as you can see below. The current registered gold is shown as the horizontal green line.

Another truckload arrived at JP Morgan's vault. That's a truckload in each of the last 5 days at JP Morgan's vault.

Yesterday I forgot to mention that the new vault operated by Asahi Depository, showed 1.2 million oz moved to registered and that is added to the comex vault registered total.

The day prior's statement for Asahi had all zeros. It was odd that their account statement didn't show metal being present the day before or being ""received"" on yesterday's report.  It just showed the ""adjustment"", which is the move to registered. Typically a move to registered has a deduct from eligible. Essentially, it just magically arrived.

Magic accounting. I wonder what's actually in Asahi's vault?

JP Morgan,📰 History Repeating – Jp Morgan & Rothschilds Redux,"📰 History Repeating – Jp Morgan & Rothschilds Redux **HISTORY REPEATING – JP MORGAN & ROTHSCHILDS REDUX** 

Little bit of a history of the gold/silver standard and what amounted to the Panic of 1896.  What’s interesting in this history lesson are the players and what they were trying to achieve – Rothschild and JP Morgan.  130 years later the same lessons are being told but the main players have not changed and the ultimate gain is banking as opposed to railway. 

JP Morgans undocumented manipulation of the gold and silver market has long been a speculated rumour and somewhat difficult thing to prove. So today we thought we’d take you on a journey back to 1895 – where speculation and government collusion were in fact tools used by JP Morgan and Rothschilds to both save the US from economic collapse and line their own pockets.  The result was the strengthening of these financial institutions, which over the years have used the same playbook to further enhance their market dominance and back-handed deals rewarding and not punishing their financial prowess.

The playbook? Wait for the government to fall into a panic or a financial crisis. Save the day. Manipulate markets to your advantage, and walk away with monopolistic powers.  In 1914 JP Morgan emerged as the major player and owner of railways in the US.  2023 JP Morgan emerges as the major player in US banking.  Both a mechanism of trade control – 1914 Industrial revolution trade control and 2023 banking and finance trade control.

**What’s a Panic?**

Rather than googling financial crisis – google panic, Pre-1900 the panic terminology appears to apply to any bubble or distorted market leading to market manipulation and panic, otherwise now known as a financial crisis.  Some examples include:

**Panic of 1819**

This was the first US widespread panic, driven by the end of the Napoleonic wars, it was compounded by asset bubbles in speculation in public lands – fueled by the unrestrained issue of ‘paper money’

**Panic of 1837**

Another panic set off from a real estate bubble and erratic American banking policy. Deflation set in with profit, prices and wages dropping.

**Panic of 1873**

This panic started in Europe with a stock market crash leading to investors liquidating bonds, in particular railway bonds in the US due to overdevelopment and speculation in railway.

**The Panic of 1893 and 1896**

Triggered by factors such as a failed coup in Argentina, a run on gold in the U.S. Treasury, and an oversupply of silver.

You see the gist here – gets a little 1800 repetitive and it was no wonder property prices remained fairly subdued throughout the 19th Century. It appears in the 20th Century, those Panic lessons may have been well and truly forgotten and the same old real estate lax banking bubbles emerged.

But for this history lesson we will focus on 1873 and 1893, and the great fortune JP Morgan was able to accumulate during this time and the role of gold and bonds that saw JP Morgan emerge as the US’s most powerful financial and railroad tycoon.

**Railroad Playbook**

JP Morgan cofounded Drexel, Morgan and company in 1871, becoming JP Morgan and company in 1895.  What seemed like a bad time to be in business turned out to be fortuitous to JP Morgan.  The Panic of 1873 started with the rampant inflation driven from overspeculation in railroads and the demonetization of silver in Germany and the US.  Following the American Civil War, 33,000 miles of railroad were built between 1868 and 1873.  Within the railroad craze a large infusion of cash was raised via bonds.  In 1871 Germany demonetized silver leading to an oversupply of silver, particularly in the US who mined most of the supply.  In 1873 the US passed the Coinage Act of 1873 backing the US dollar to a de facto gold standard.   This immediately depressed silver prices further, reduced money supply and raised interest rates hurting farmers.  People then shied away from long term bonds and collapsed the railway bond market.

In 1873 the precipice of the Panic happened when Jay Cooke and Company couldn’t sell millions of dollars of Northern Pacific Railway Bonds leading to its bankruptcy. By 1874 60 railroads had gone bankrupt 

In 1875 Congress backed the USD with gold helping to curb and stabilize the dollar.

It was 10 years after the collapse in railway bonds that JP Morgan emerged as a railway force, this time reorganizing railways, merging them and taking stakes, such as in 1885 when he arranged a merger between New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad.  

**Morgan-Belmont Syndicate**

Following the 1893 Panic, paper money was being exchanged for gold from treasury, draining the US Treasury of gold.  The hot money movement as it was later known had all the hallmarks of a self compelling bank run on Treasury due to a distrust of the US government’s gold reserve.  There was a rapid decline in gold reserves from $121,0000,000 on January 1st 1893 to $66,000,000 on February 1st 1894.  Under these circumstances the government used 4 subscriptions of $50,000,000 of 5% 10 year bonds over a 1894-1895.  But each time treasury again saw gold continue to pour out of treasury.  Speculative international transactions prompted by the fear of the ceasing of the gold standard saw another net outflow of $84,000,000 between October 1894 and January 1895, investors were liquidating bank balances and railroad bonds for gold and sending this gold to Europe at an increasing rate.

To assist with the US predicament a famous meeting between President Cleveland and JP Morgan in 1895 produced a syndicate and its contract on February 8th 1895.  The contract failed to name syndicate members with a veil of secrecy, although it is now known the syndicate included both Rothschilds and JP Morgan to name some of the more notable firms.  The contract was for the syndicate to bolster gold stock and stop outflows. The syndicate agreed to purchase 3,500,000 ounces of gold and sell it to the government with 4% 30 year bonds.  

The syndicate acquired $62,315,400 in government bonds at a 4% return, which they sold at 3 ¾% almost immediately for $68,833,591 – a tidy $5,000,000 immediate profit. Additional to the gold they delivered, within a week the syndicate saw other gold inflows of $10,000,000 from domestic holders.

The second condition was the syndicate exert control on the market (manipulate) to stop gold outflows.  The syndicate contract lasted 6 months, with the Syndicate manipulating control over the exchange rate to ensure enhanced profits from the arrangements

*‘The unique and imprecise manner by which authority was delegated by the government to a private syndicate to control the foreign-exchange market would be unthinkable in modern time’*

During this time it was also identified that the syndicate used moral suasion (more manipulation) to ensure other gold holders/investors did not withdraw further gold.  They appealed to these investors by giving bonds at preferential terms they would adhere to the ‘ship no gold’ agreement. Articles at the time supported the Syndicate and the moral suasion such as the United States Investor revered the Syndicate for stopping the previous deflation 

‘*To those persons to criticize the bond syndicate for keeping the price of the exchange at such high figures, it is sufficient to say that had the Syndicate not intervened, the cost of paying debts cold be even greater than at present, because gold would be in transit instead of exchange.’*

The Syndicate succeeded in reinvigorating faith in the US government and dollar and saw a period of prosperity follow, but it seems from this point the US Government owed the architects of the syndicate a favour.   And it appears during this time the Syndicate learnt the economic benefits of precious metal manipulation.

The end of the agreement saw Europe liquidate some of these railway bonds, which we’re sure became the icing on JP Morgans Railway cake as he emerged in 1902 as the largest US railway owner, controlling 5,000 miles of US railroads.

**JP Morgan and First Republic Bank today**

We all know this more recent story of JP Morgans takeover of multiple banks – Bear Sterns, First Republic Bank with the government again leaning on the financial Behemoth to help save the US dollar.  But just like in 1895 the favors and profits to be made are enhancing both the strength and influence of JP Morgan. 

During the First Republic deal laws were broken and profits were made, putting JP Morgan in a stronger monopolistic position in US banking, just like the railways in 1902.

The US law that needed to be circumvented, as JPMorgan ‘*is so big that by* **law it would not be allowed to buy First Republic** *because no one bank can have more than a 10 per cent market’*

And the profit made by JP Morgan: *‘Recognize an upfront, one-time, post-tax gain of approximately $2.6 billion, which does not reflect the approximately $2.0 billion dollars of post-tax restructuring costs anticipated over the next 18 months’*

History Repeats.

**Finally just a little bit of 2023/1873 comparison**

* 1998 tech boom leading to the 2000 collapse- with overinvestment and hype in a new technology – railway vs internet (Panic of 1873)
* 2008 Financial Crisis and deflation (Panic of 1895)
* And finally 2022 inflation, 14 years after the GFC, bought on by Covid, compared  the 1917  during and proceeding World War 1. With inflation in 1920 hitting 25% and 1921 a sharp reversal -15% so will we see a similar pattern in 2024/2025?

JP Morgan,14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect.,"14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect. Excuse me ... change that headline to registered vault. No hyperbole intended. On with the show ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A huge move, 14.7 tonne or 471,000 oz, is out of registered gold on today's vault report ... all of it out of JP Morgan's vault.

Often, but not always, metal moved out of registered ends up being moved out of the vault soon thereafter. Time will tell on that. Regardless, it is a move away from being sold at comex. The size of the move is noteworthy.

Inquiring minds want to know ... who did it? Obviously, it could be any of the comex players who had 14.7 tonne or more in JP Morgan's vault. But that rules out a lot of entities.

I can guess who may be on that short list based on who bought gold recently from JP Morgan or JP Morgan customer accounts. If they stopped metal from those players, the gold would reside in JP Morgan's vault.

Recall that on March 30 of this year JP Morgan issued delivery notices on 10,682 gold contracts. That's 33.2 tonne of gold. I'm talking the house account. The bank. They had shorted gold like f'ing hell during the $150 March rally in an attempt to defend the cabal's fiat. If they hadn't gold would have gone up a lot more than $150.

Here's the procedure to guess who removed the metal: 

Since the metal is in JP Morgan's vault, I looked at all the gold sold by JP Morgan and its customer accounts only. Scrolling back through time, those entities sold 320,000 oz or 3.82 tonne from March 31 onward ... not enough to source today's vault departure.

In other words, if this is metal was bought recently, it would have to include part of the 33.2 tonne sold by JP Morgan's house account on March 30. 

That's extremely interesting. That was an epic sale by JP Morgan. It was the largest sale ever for them, and now it may be involved in metal moving out of comex.

Next, I looked at who stopped (bought) that 33.2 tonne JP Morgan sold on March 30. While you typically don't know which short's metal went to which long, in this case JP Morgan accounted for 63% of the gold sold that day, so you can guess that the big buyers that day got a sizable piece of JP Morgan's metal.

Below are the players who stopped more than one tonne that day. The primary suspects from this list are BofA, Citi and Morgan Stanley customer accounts.

&#x200B;

Next I looked at all the ***net*** metal stopped since March 30 by all comex players. This would be from any and all sellers. See the list below. Note that some of this metal may have been acquired from non-JP Morgan sellers, but it would be near impossible to screen further to who stopped metal from only JP Morgan's vault.

https://preview.redd.it/exdzw80fnv1b1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=56832df2c8b05b5875e7984557805b7f5a5634d2

Note that Citi isn't on the list as they sold all of the metal bought on March 30 (plus another 5%). So Citi is off the suspect list and the list is down to 2.

Morgan Stanley customers acquired 8.1 tonne on March 30 and another 1.8 tonne after March 30. Their accrued net purchase since March 30 is 9.9 tonne. It IS possible that they moved their newly bought 9.9 tonne plus another 4.8 tonne they had bought previously, but this is less likely. Furthermore, this all assumes that Morgan Stanley customers are all acting together, or are (mostly) one entity.  I think they are a long shot.

That leaves BofA. What about them?

BofA stopped 13.6 tonne on March 30 and another 16.9 tonne since for a total of 30.5 tonne. Furthermore, they haven't sold **any** gold at all over the last 4 months which is an indication of the direction of their intent ... not flipping metal. The accumulated gold bought since March 30 far surpasses today's vault move of 14.7 tonne. They are the lead suspect.

Who'dve thunk. It wasn't Putin or Xi after all.

The possibility that one of comex's biggest gold players is buying metal and removing it from (at least) registered, is significant. BofA has bought a net 125 tonne since becoming active in early 2021. If this 14.7 tonne is their metal, that would be 12% of their stack.  And maybe more is going out!

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Silver Vaults

JP Morgan did NOT move a truckload into the vaults today, unlike the prior 7 days. Perhaps their silver stack rebuild is complete at 4.2 million oz. If so, that is nothing like the volumes they could effortlessly deliver with the click of the mouse, like 30 million oz at a time. That was before they were downgraded to jay pee pee.

A net 340,000 oz is out of the vault and 400,000 oz was moved out of registered at JP Morgan's vault. BofA?

That's 18% of registered ... over twice the typical. Plus, JP Morgan's 7 day vault re-stack binge is now up to 4.2 million oz of silver. 5 days to first notice. The June inactive month silver contract is counting down to first notice day with 5 (biz) days to go. The OI has stabilized at 1,133 contracts or about 5.5 million oz. Just noticing that the SIL contract (the 1,000 oz micro) has about 1.2 million oz ready to stand for delivery too.

Back to just the SI contract ... while that OI plots as near the average of prior contracts (shown below on the countdown plot), it is much greater than recent months.

&#x200B;

Plus, as a fraction of registered silver, it's one of the highest months over the last 3 years. At the current OI, it accounts for 18.5% of registered whereas the average inactive month (at day 5) is 7.3%:

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold

Gold contracts continue to close with the total OI declining 6,192 contracts. Based on recent price activity, you'd assume this is being driven by longs closing contracts.

https://preview.redd.it/i91alig6wm1b1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=31297c4b924435057c017bd92e2bd80531dcacae

The June contract is now rolling to August, so I track the OI with the sum of the two:

&#x200B;

Based on the June countdown plot, it would appear that of the roll pair contracts (June and August) most of the reduction is in the August contract. I say that because the June contract is 16,000 below the mean, whereas the sum of the two is 39,000 below the mean. The June contract OI is as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/jdk80qrswm1b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=40e5fdb3603b296e3f830848ef2a8677fb016523

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver Vaults

For the 7th day in a row a truckload was received at JP Morgan's vault. If you've not yet been enlightened, a truckload in my jargon is 600,000 oz. A lot of comex silver moves in lots of 600k. That is also a typical payload that can be moved by most class 8 trucks in the USA. Converted to lbs that is 41,000. And for you people that haven't yet converted, that is 18,800 kilos.

So that is now 4.2 million oz of newly arrived metal at JP Morgan's vault over the last 7 days. This is not unlike JP Morgan's restocking of 30 tonne of gold with 6 deposits between March 31 and May 2.

Today, however, the 600k oz deposit at JP Morgan was offset by a 1.1 million oz move out of the vault. Furthermore, 35,000 oz was transferred out of registered at JP Morgan's vault.

For the totals of all 10 comex vaults,  600k was moved in, 2.5 million oz was moved out for a net decline of 1.9 million oz. Also 280,000 oz was moved out of registered to eligible.

JP Morgan,Another 7.5 tonne of gold moved out of JP Morgan's registered vault brings the 3 day total to 25.9 tonne and zeros out the entirety of comex 400 oz registered gold.,"Another 7.5 tonne of gold moved out of JP Morgan's registered vault brings the 3 day total to 25.9 tonne and zeros out the entirety of comex 400 oz registered gold. The comex gold contracts had another large reduction in open interest dropping by 10,886 contracts. Give it a yawn. That is typical for this point in the cycle (2 days to first notice).  Basically, there are a lot of folks who hang around with about 5 or 6 days to go who are not hedgers. They are arbs or folks trying to pick up some fiat as the herd rolls or closes. They just close without rolling.

The raw numbers:

That 10,886 decline drops the OI well below the pre-OI surge level from about 3 weeks ago:

https://preview.redd.it/xjbmrdinq92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6adea51f149847d74ad0d99d96b7581023a865f

Currently we are in the last days of the roll period from the June contract to the August contract. See the OI countdown plot below. The number of contracts that closed on the June contract was 42,498 which is exactly the average.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8xkqppht92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=aced6c293570491b5b3faa1f8cb908fc879e22ac

What happened, and almost always happens at this point, is that many of those contracts didn't roll to August. They just closed. The new August contracts totaled 31,219 or 11,279 less. However, this 11,279 is routine for day 2. In fact usually it is even greater at 14,500.

&#x200B;

The June contract OI is now 58% of registered metal in the vault:

https://preview.redd.it/wr5tgow8t92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e979180681727b76d38dc43ce874581637c24fb

Moving on the the gold vaults ...  the story at JP Morgan's vault is more bizarre. There was an additional 242,611 oz (or 7.5 tonne) moved out of JP Morgan's vault. This time the move was from the 400 oz vault.

You may recall the March 2020 near crack up at comex. In an effort to add physical supply, comex changed its rules such that contracts could be settled with 400 oz bars in addition the the usual 100 oz bars. An additional category was added to the vault report specifically for the 400 oz bars.

Considering all of comex (not just JP Morgan), as of yesterday's report only 242,611 oz or 2% of comex registered gold consisted of 400 oz bars. That gives some indication of how many settlements consist of 400 oz bars. Eligible gold consisted of 3,895,686 oz (or 35%) in 400 oz bars.

Therefore, this 242,611 oz move from registered to eligible zeros out comex registered in the 400 oz bar category.

&#x200B;

Was that 242,611 oz move on today's report also BofA?   Over the two prior days BofA (at least it is a high probability it was BofA) moved 18.3 tonne out of JP Morgan's registered (in the 100 oz vault). I'd bet that it was BofA which would bring their 3 day move out of registered to 25.9 tonne.

Moving on to other vault changes ... there was also a 250,778 oz (7.8 tonne) move *into* registered at JP Morgan's vault.

Since that is all getting complicated, I'll cut and paste the raw report for the JP Morgan portion of the vault report:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3uuerj4ix92b1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=e88e1bc33b92e57df360b739a6ace2fb47080dbb

I doubt that BofA is moving metal out of, and then back into, registered. So I don't think this is connected to the discussion above. I suspect that we will see someone issue 2,510 contracts early next week.  I'll wait until then to see who's name is printed on the issues and stops report. I have a premonition who that may be.

&#x200B;

Other vault moves ... one tonne into MTB's vault. And the net of all that is ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver

First notice day on the June inactive silver contract is also Monday. FYI ... FND of gold and silver contracts are always synced. The June silver open interest continues flat at 1,114 contracts or 5.57 million oz. Another 1.34 million oz is about to stand for delivery on the micro contract for a total of 6.91 million oz. That'll require 23% of the registered silver.

Speaking of the vault, registered dropped below 30 million oz again. 600 k is out of registered at MTB and 300 k out at HSBC.

The new vault, Asahi, showed 600 k oz arriving with a small offset of 55 k oz departing. The net of all that is ...

That is on top of yesterday's 471,000 oz or 14.7 tonne bringing the 2 day total to 18.3 tonne. 

So far, none of that metal has left the vault ... according to the vault reports.

In yesterday's piece, I showed analysis that points the finger at BofA for being the responsible party. You gotta read daily as I can't keep a post concise and repeat the relevant history:

These new vault withdrawal numbers are completely consistent with my BofA guess. In fact, strengthens the BofA case because the alternatives had bought much less than BofA recently. Yesterday I mentioned that there is a lot more where that came from ... and there still is.

Separately, there was a 7.0 tonne deposit at Malca Amit's vault. That is a 35% increase. I don't have any recon on who that could be, but I suspect their name will be on the issues and stops report on Monday.

The upcoming June gold contract is an active month and with first notice day on Monday. The OI trajectory has been declining less than usual the last few days as you can see in the plot below.

Usually the number of contracts standing for delivery ranges from 10-20%. Apparently the gold vaults are managed with more cushion than the silver vaults. Why? Probably because a delivery miss on gold would be game over.

The daily change in OI of the front month contract is shown below. It's the derivative of the plot above. Note that today's trading, day 2 before first notice day, usually has the largest decline in OI.

As the June contract appears at the average (bold black line) on the first plot, when adjusted for the reduction in registered gold, the OI is one of the higher contracts. The June contract has 95% of registered gold compared to the average of 75%.

The OI on the June silver contract, an inactive month, is holding around 1,120 contracts. Traders generally don't roll on inactive month contracts which is why the OI isn't plunging like the active month gold contract.

JP Morgan,Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank,"Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are helping the Ukrainian government set up a reconstruction bank to steer public seed capital into rebuilding projects that can attract hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment.

The Ukraine Development Fund remains in the planning stages and is not expected to fully launch until the end of hostilities with Russia. But investors will have a preview this week at a London conference co-hosted by the British and Ukrainian governments.

“So many of today’s long-term challenges are best addressed through blended finance and this is one. You need these vehicles to mobilise capital at scale,” said BlackRock vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand, who will be discussing the work on Wednesday.

The World Bank estimated in March that Ukraine would need $411bn to rebuild after the war, and recent Russian attacks have driven that figure higher.

The Kyiv government engaged BlackRock’s consulting arm in November to determine how best to attract that kind of capital, and then added JPMorgan in February. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced last month that the country was working with the two financial groups and consultants at McKinsey.

No formal fundraising target has been set but people familiar with the discussions say the fund is seeking to raise low-cost capital from governments, donors and international financial institutions and leverage it to attract between five and 10 times as much private investment.

BlackRock and JPMorgan are donating their services, although the work will give them an early look at possible investments in the country. The assignment also deepens JPMorgan’s relationship with a longstanding client. The bank has helped Ukraine raise more than $25bn in sovereign debt since 2010 and led the country’s $20bn debt restructuring last year.

The financiers consulted with private and public sector investors and found they wanted to help Ukraine but were leery not just about war losses but also the country’s governance, lack of transparency and shallow capital markets.

What Ukraine needed, BlackRock advised, was a development finance bank to find investment opportunities in sectors such as infrastructure, climate and agriculture and make them attractive to pension funds and other long-term investors and lenders. JPMorgan was brought in partly for its debt expertise.

“The fund is being set up to also give public and private sector investors the opportunity to invest into specific projects and sectors,” said Stefan Weiler, JPMorgan’s head of debt capital markets for central Europe, Middle East and Africa. “There will be different sectoral funds that the fund identified as priorities for Ukraine. The aim is maximise capital participation.”

The structure calls for the fund to use the lower-cost public money, known as concessional capital, to make initial investments and absorb the first losses.

The notion is that this initial seed capital would be a de-risking mechanism, and it would create the potential for private sector capital to come in at scale,” said Brandon Hall, co-head of BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory arm. “Ukraine will have its own organisation to source and syndicate these local investment opportunities.”

To overcome investor concerns about governance, the fund is expected to stock its board with representatives of international financial institutions and governments and hire investment professionals to execute its strategy.

“Our view is that if you have a strong governance structure and an internationally credible set of stakeholders who are in the leadership position in this fund, then that will go a long way,” Hall said",0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,https://on.ft.com/443yCpg,06/20/2023,06:27:00,DoYouWant_the_Cheese,21,Africa

JP Morgan is almost certainly restocking the silver vault with a third day in a row of a truckload deposit. Plus Degen ""erisorto"" wins the prize. Yesterday I was writing about the roll period where traders close their position on an upcoming active month contract and open a position in the next active month contract. A high fraction of contracts roll forward as such.

Furthermore, near the start of the roll period, there is a large increase in the number of TAS contracts on both the outgoing and incoming contracts. Basically, traders often utilize the trade at settlement (TAS) alternative to close and/or open their positions.

Below is a plot of the TAS volume for each contract. Focus on the pink shaded ""outgoing"" TAS period around day 17 to 8 days to first notice.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e985osbjvf0b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a39de36f63f00125720a7e6396fde1f07c0a327

It's not readily apparent on the above plot, but the TAS surge almost always lasts 5 continuous business days. Furthermore, it never starts on a Wednesday.

The question I asked was ... why doesn't the TAS surge start on Wednesdays?

FYI ... below are the stats on the start of the 5 day surge:

https://preview.redd.it/vzdenod4wf0b1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e04b0042f57f51528efc32e2f2f9e4b1253d7b

Of the 12,500 degenerates who read yesterday's post, only 1 person figured that out.

Aaaand the winner is ""erisorto"" of the SilverDegenClub:

https://preview.redd.it/ff9an4ydwf0b1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=427333350efa3556ba4ff6f365e2ae08816323f1

To add some commentary to erisorto's comments ...  a couple of months back, the sum total of the 5 day TAS surge was a lot less than usual. I thought I could then look at the CoT and see which category of trader had declined by comparing two subsequent CoT reports. If there was some correlation, that could infer which type of trader exploits TAS during those 5 days.

I then realized that that particular 5 day TAS period spanned 2 CoT reports. That fuzzes up the numbers because you then have to look at three subsequent reports to determine the changes.  It fuzzed things up enough that it wasn't apparent which category was involved.

I looked back through time and ALL of the TAS surge numbers spanned 2 reports. What a coincidink!

FYI ... the CoT report is based on traders position at the end of trading on Tuesday (and posted on Friday). The only way to get a clean week to week change between just 2 reports would be if the TAS surge started on a Wednesday. And that's why it never starts on Wednesday!

Everyone will want to start pointing fingers at the CME folks. However, note that the exchange has no rules or guidance about when to roll, or whether to use TAS or not. It's the traders themselves who decide. Apparently, the vast majority of traders decide to not roll their own position on Wednesdays. Furthermore, they mostly avoid Tuesday and Thursday because that splits the change at a 4:1 ratio (or 1:4). By rolling on Monday or Friday, the change is split by a 3:2 (or 2:3) for maximum obfuscation and that is what they do 75% of the time.

The traders are obfuscating data about themselves. The core driver of this is the weekly schedule of the CoT report with positions reported from the Tuesday close. It would be interesting to see if the CFTC required traders to report, say, twice a week. Would the traders modify their 5 day TAS surge?

Congrats to erisorto.  Comex traders have been parading him around the comex pits all day. He's got an interview on CNBC set for tomorrow morning at the opening bell, plus a visit to the White House later in the week.

And on with the new stuff:

Yesterday I wrote about the gold open interest surging ahead by 14,416 contracts on Monday and how that invited a (price) beat down. Although, when I wrote that, the beat down was in progress (on Tuesday). What I didn't know was the beat down reversed that entire OI increase, dropping OI by 14,189 contracts.

One of the larger OI increases immediately followed by one of the larger reductions:

What happened with silver? The Tuesday smack down did drive a few longs out of the May silver contract ... just 22 contracts. But a near offsetting number (18) opened June contracts as you can see below. This may seem like small potatoes but between the tail of the May contract and the upcoming June contract,  7-1/2 million oz will need delivered shortly. The June contract is an inactive month and typically all of those dudes hang around for delivery.

The shorts on the May contract continue to not deliver metal ... zero delivery notices last night. Eight days left to deliver.

# The firm’s market access controls failed to prevent five erroneous orders routed to exchanges and alternative trading systems:

* On January 30, 2019, a firm trader on the Program Trading Agency Desk routed to the market an order to purchase 50,000 shares of an equity security. 
   * The trader intended to enter a limit price of $268.50, but mistakenly input $286.50. 
   * The firm received executions with prices over 5% higher than the last execution in the market prior to entry of this order. 
   * The firm submitted clearly erroneous filings and approximately half of the 50,000-share order (executions above $276.57) were busted. 
* On July 26, 2019, a client entered a market order to sell 86,500 equity shares instead of the intended limit order. 
   * A trader accepted the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The last share price at the time of order entry was $27.23. 
   * The firm received executions at prices down to $22.25, representing an approximately 18% drop. 
* On December 19, 2019, instead of entering a limit-on-close order, a firm trader on the Equity Finance Trading Desk erroneously entered a limit order to buy 230,000 shares of an equity security at $154.17. 
   * The firm routed the order to the market and received executions with prices up to $154.17, which was approximately 3% higher than the prior execution price at order entry of $149.52. 
   * The firm filed a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $154.01 were busted. 
* On March 26, 2020, a client entered a pairs order in the firm’s system. 
   * While a firm algorithm was handling the order, a control paused the order for manual review. 
   * After the review and the resumption of the order, the algorithm handling the order did not refresh the market data to account for the pause. 
   * In less than one minute, the system routed to various execution venues over 80,000 immediate-or-cancel orders, which the execution venues canceled back unfilled because they were priced away from the prevailing market. 
* On April 22, 2021, a client entered a market order to buy 4,765 equity shares but intended to buy 50 shares at a limit price of $4,765. 
   * The Electronic Client Solutions Desk received the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The firm received executions with prices up to $5,077.30, which was approximately 6% higher than the last traded price of $4,799.99. 
   * The firm submitted a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $4,903.50 were busted. 

# The firm’s erroneous order and duplicative order controls were not reasonably designed:  

* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied fixed single order quantity limits ranging from 100,000 to 9,999,999 shares depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client involved in each order. 
   * The firm also applied static single order notional value limits ranging from $25,000,000 to $500,000,000 depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client. Each of these single order quantity and single order notional value limits applied static limits regardless of security and thus failed to consider the individual characteristics of the security. 
   * The firm further applied average daily volume limits ranging from 25 to 50 percent based on the specific desk, trader, and/or client.
   *  With the exception of one desk’s single order quantity control, the firm’s single order quantity, single order notional value, and average daily value thresholds were too large to be effective, and the firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set them at such levels.
* Moreover, many of the above referenced size controls triggered “soft blocks” when applicable thresholds were reached. 
   * In contrast to a “hard block,” which generally prevents an order from being submitted by automatically rejecting it, a soft block pauses an order until the block is overridden or the order is cancelled back or modified. 
      * For most of the relevant period, however, the firm’s written supervisory procedures did not address how to handle, document, and review soft block overrides. 
      * Accordingly, the firm’s controls that relied on soft blocks did not prevent the entry of certain erroneous orders. 
      * By January 2021, the firm implemented changes to its supervisory requirements relating to soft blocks that included tracking and reviews of soft block overrides and adding compliance trainings and updates to its written supervisory procedures on the handling of soft blocks.
* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied single order limit price controls based on fixed percentages away from the National Best Bid and Offer, ranging from three to 15 percent depending on the desk, trader, and/or client involved. 
   * Like the firm’s size controls, certain limit price thresholds were set too high to be effective. 
   * In particular, the limit price controls generally exceeded the numerical guidelines for clearly erroneous transactions. 
   * The firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set its limit price thresholds at levels greater than the definition of a clearly erroneous transaction. 
      * Additionally, for the same reasons previously noted above, the firm’s supervisory system for soft blocks was deficient for most of the relevant period. 
      * In October 2020, the firm began introducing a price control that applied different thresholds to differently priced securities.  
* Furthermore, the firm did not have a reasonable duplicative order control. 
   * The firm did apply a risk control that checked orders with the same symbol, side, and quantity. 
   * This control triggered a hard block if more than 50,000 order messages with the same symbol, side, and quantity were sent within two seconds. 
   * However, the 50,000-order threshold, which was applied separately to each of the firm’s connections to external venues, was too high to be effective. 
   * The firm provided no documented rationale supporting why such a high threshold was reasonable. 

As of July 2022, the firm had implemented additional controls to prevent the entry of orders that—based on price and/or size of the order relative to the market—could potentially lead to unintended market impact.

>Yet, in addition to close associates of Wexner, Dimon’s coronation as one of the most powerful bankers in the country was also made possible thanks to another powerful clan that also shares close connections to Wexner – the Crown family of Chicago. Perhaps even more than Wexner, the Crowns are a testament to how the worlds of organized crime and corporate power have mixed over the years to produce elites who are truly untouchable. With a long-standing dominant role in the American military-industrial complex as well as other facets of the corporate world, the Crowns have a history of doing what’s necessary – whether legal or illegal – to get what they want to advance their political agendas and grow their own power. Even presidents and the Pentagon have been unable to successfully challenge them. As this article will show, the Crowns – perhaps more than any other group – are a critical part of the story of how Jame Dimon became the king of Wall Street.

Plus, JP Morgan has now nearly restocked its gold vault after dumping 33.5 tonne of gold $200 ago. That's the ""smart"" money! After a huge 3 day surge followed by a one day drop, the total gold contract open interest has settled into normalcy. The June contract is now a few days into the roll period as that contract's OI is falling and the roll month of August is increasing.

Typically there is a total OI increase during this portion of the roll, so today's total OI increase of 3,166 is normal compared to the average of 3,570. You can see the OI cycle below where the solid black line is the arithmetic average:

Isolating the June and August contracts shows the same impact:

Meanwhile back at the May contract which is currently in the delivery period, 218 net new gold contracts were written on Tuesday.  There's still plenty of time left, so call your broker and buy a few gold bars for near immediate delivery.

&#x200B;

The issues and stops report shows mostly JP Morgan customers selling gold to other JP Morgan customers. The big players that were very active earlier in the month, BofA and Citi, have ceased activity for now.

Let's talk silver!

The upcoming June contract's OI has increased to 981, or about 4.9 million oz, and is much higher than recent months. This is an inactive month and typically, these contracts stay open and take delivery. You can see that in the flat bold black average line which stays mostly flat during the run up to first notice day. That's in sharp contrast to the active months where OI is plunging toward FND. Real men buy inactive months ... apparently.

&#x200B;

That 4.9 million oz is 18% of registered vault totals. If you think of it relative to the registered vault total, suddenly the June contract OI is almost twice the average inactive month. See the plot below.

Perhaps that's why some silver is arriving at the vaults lately.

Speaking of the silver vaults, after increasing for each of the last 3 days, 220,000 oz departed the vaults:

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Gold Vaults

The gold vaults saw 55,000 oz arrive at JP Morgan's vault. There have been six 160,000 oz deposits over the last 28 business days. Perhaps today's report is the final installment of JP Morgan's gold rebuild as this brings the recent total deposited to 31.7 tonnes. Recall that they sold 33.5 tonnes on the April contract as they apparently defended the cabal's fiat during the March gold rally.

JP Morgan,"We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan?","We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan? Microstrategy has an insane plan. It's wildly complex and super intricate. After much analysis I have concluded the following:

When BTC goes up, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC goes down, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC crabs, MS buys Bitcoin

When Michael Saylor is sued, MS buys Bitcoin

It may be a bit hard to follow but I can dumb in down for you: MS buys Bitcoin.

I even made a joke of it here, and I think we generally view MS as on 'our side' but MS currently owns around 140,000 BTC which is about 0.72% of circulating supply. It's doesn't sound like *that* much but it's pretty close to close to an entire 1%. In fact, it's almost certain that they will own more than 1% of the total supply at the end of all this. And that percentage is deceiving because we don't know how many BTC is permanently burned, but it's likely quite a lot, so the actual percentage they'll own will be even greater. Chainalysis estimates that up to 20% of the Bitcoin already issued may be permanently lost, which means they own more like 0.9% of what's left.

To put their buys into perspective, in just 2 years since March 2021, they managed to purchase 0.25% of circulating supply. Estimates have put the final Bitcoin to be mined in 2140. Of course, most of us won't be alive, but if MS continues at current rates, they'll have another 2.5% of supply in just 10 years. This is a hard estimate as their are many factors to this but it's fair enough I think. Imagine how much they'll earn in 30 years alone, when we would have all grown old(er).

I don't think we'll look at then the way we do now.",0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12fz6jg/we_encourage_and_laugh_with_microstrategy_now_but/,04/09/2023,02:35:43,OneThatNoseOne,324,Africa

JP Morgan,JP Morgan Chase earnings report,"JP Morgan Chase earnings report The 2023 Q2 earnings report for JPMorgan Chase has just been released. Overall, the ER is a remarkable demonstration of the durability and power of the top bank. JPM's results, both top and bottom line, exceeded market forecasts. The fact that the bank declared a solid balance sheet during and after a highly tumultuous time for the banking industry is, in my opinion, more significant.   
The last one or two quarters have been described by certain media as the most difficult for banks since the 2008 crisis. JPM was able to keep a healthy standardised CET1 capital ratio of 13.8% even after the First Republic deal. J.P. Morgan was able to negotiate a favourable price because they were the only reliable buyer for FRC. In a back-of-the-envelope analysis of the transaction, Matt Levine of Bloomberg noted how J.P. Morgan receives good upside and regulatory protection while sharing a large portion of the potential losses if the loans default. Although the estimated $500 million in annual net income for the agreement is small in comparison to the $40 billion or so they already generate, it demonstrates that a bank like JPMorgan can take advantage of the crisis.  
The bank currently has $1.4 trillion in cash and short-term securities, which is a lot of liquidity. I have no doubt that JPM will be able to fulfil these new standards and keep its fortress balance sheet, even though there may be some capital changes and liquidity in the near future as the banking industry adapts to new rules.  
Given the current instability in the banking industry, regulatory standards may be modified in various ways. With Basel III's completion, Dimon himself anticipates ""material changes"" to capital and liquidity. He continued by issuing a warning that the market as a whole as well as end customers would probably be affected by these regulatory changes in the real world.

JP Morgan,Registered silver continues to drain with another truckload out of registered at Brinks. JP Morgan's gold vault sees 5 tonne hasta la vaulta. That is 3% of their vault total.,"Registered silver continues to drain with another truckload out of registered at Brinks. JP Morgan's gold vault sees 5 tonne hasta la vaulta. That is 3% of their vault total. &#x200B;

Following up from last week's analysis, the July contract continues adding net new contracts for immediate delivery. Friday saw 32 move contracts tacked on or 160,000 koz. The cumulative after 5 days is 402 contracts or 2.01 million oz or 5.8% of registered silver.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syii3vhe17bb1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd535a20564b936aed1d04018e6614108bf1eb1

At the silver vaults one even truckload was removed from Brinks' vault. That is 3 days in a row where one even truckload was moved out of registered. I'd surmise that this party is whoever bought part of the 12 million oz sold by Standard Chartered (and delivered out of Brinks' vault). Only 3 parties were issued more than 1.8 million oz that day ...

&#x200B;

* JP Morgan customer accounts -    6.070 million oz
* BofA                                                   2.565 million oz
* Morgan Stanley house account - 2.225 million oz.

Time may tell, or at least indicate, who is moving metal out of registered. It all 12 million oz moves out, that'd be 17 more truckloads.  And, for the record, I'm not predicting that.

&#x200B;

I thought it was odd that silver was moving out of registered in 600 koz batches even thought it hasn't (yet) moved out of the vault. I've documented that silver moves in or out of the vault in 600 koz tranches, but moves from registered to eligible or versa vice could be different.

I don't know if vaults segregate registered from eligible. If it was just a digital reassignment, you'd think they could change status of any amount of silver with just a click the mouse. If they actually move the metal, there could be size considerations to change status.

Curiosity got the best of me and I did the stats. Moves in and out of registered ARE more frequent than most other size moves except small moves (-250,000 to +50,000).  See the histogram below.

And those are thousands of oz on the x-axis:

&#x200B;

But if you consider the percentage of total oz moved, the truckload size change jumps out:

https://preview.redd.it/sc55raxna7bb1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd21a233c2f840bda40cd4f36d7bd5a552f571e

It's possible that there are moves into or out of registered in 600 koz lots only because it arrives or departs the vaults in those sizes. I'm saying that because often silver moves in or out of the vault occur before or soon after the change from registered. To get to the bottom of that, I'd have to strip out moves that weren't associated with a move in or out of the vault. Ain't doing that right now. Maybe someday.

At the end of all that ... I don't know why these 3 Brinks' moves have been 3 sequential 600 koz changes and the metal remains in eligible.

MTB also moved 100 koz out of registered:

The JP Morgan withdrawal isn't connected to any recent moves from registered. The last move exceeding 5 tonne from JP Morgan's registered was May 23, or 34 biz days ago.

Perhaps their recent gold vault build will be reversed:

JP Morgan,"JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz.","JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz. The total of JP Morgan's vault of registered silver has dwindled from over 40 million oz at the start of the silver squeeze to 8.1 million oz.

The JP Morgan vault would be the total of JP Morgan, the bank's silver, and customer silver. Typically JP Morgan's house account doesn't keep much silver in registered so this move out today is likely silver owned by customer accounts.

A couple of weeks ago I had written that I identified BofA as removing vast quantities of gold, 25.9 tonne, from registered at JP Morgan's vault.  This could be BofA's silver.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another\_75\_tonne\_of\_gold\_moved\_out\_of\_jp\_morgans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another_75_tonne_of_gold_moved_out_of_jp_morgans/)

&#x200B;

JP Morgan's eligible metal stands at 133.3 million oz. From that, deduct the 103 million oz that is ""owned"" by SLV's authorized participants (and probably a few other parties) which leaves 30.3 million oz. Again, that would be the total of customer and the bank's silver.

I had documented the occasions where it became apparent that the JP Morgan, the bank, was out of silver during 2022 although they have likely restocked to some extent. I always pay special attention to JP Morgan as they are the cabal's lead banker.

Today's comex total of 27.3 million oz is a 6.5 year low last seen in December 29, 2016.

The record low was just 6 months earlier at 22,482,450 oz which occurred for a 7 day stretch ending June 14, 2016.

Another day with no delivery notices on the June silver contract where 2.16 million oz awaits delivery. Same on the micro silver contract where another 324 koz await delivery. On the micro silver contract, the naked short is CME. Yes those are the folks that run the comex exchange. 

As the tide runs out we're going to learn who else is shorting naked:

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  July silver contracts

Yesterday I mentioned there was a surge in ""privately negotiated trades"" on the upcoming July silver contract which arrested the two week surge in open interest.  The heightened PNT trades continued with 3,361 contracts. Despite that the total OI had a modest gain of 1,266 contracts:

It is interesting to note that the July contract OI at day 9 is 12.5 times the registered vault total, and that is the highest in the post covid era. But you should skip this plot too:

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold Vaults

There was a large move out of the gold vaults at JP Morgan's vaults, 221 koz or 6.86 tonne. That's 2.5% of JP Morgan's vault total and 1% of comex total.

A couple of weeks ago I documented huge moves at JP Morgan's gold vault as metal  moved out of registered. Now it appears that it is going out of the vault.

On May 23 and 24 there were 589 koz or 18.3 tonne moved out of registered. I posted an analysis that showed that the likely perp was almost certainly BofA. They are the only party that has net stopped that much gold, specifically 30.5 tonne since March 30 of this year and 124 tonne over the last 2-1/2 years.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147\_tonne\_vacates\_jp\_morgans\_comex\_gold\_vault/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147_tonne_vacates_jp_morgans_comex_gold_vault/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13rrxjy/the\_2\_day\_departure\_of\_gold\_out\_of\_jp\_morgans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13rrxjy/the_2_day_departure_of_gold_out_of_jp_morgans/)

Since those moves out of registered, JP Morgan's gold vault has been fairly quiet. It isn't a certainty that this is BofA's gold that was 1) recently bought at comex and 2) moved out of registered and 3) now moved out of the vault. But it is likely. 

If it is BofA's gold, this 6.86 tonne would represent 38% of the that 18.3 tonne moved out of registered on May 23 and 23. We may get some clarity in the days ahead if there is a follow up move(s) out of the vault.

Why care? BofA has been a huge buyer of gold at comex over the last 2-1/2 years. They have bought a net 4.0 million oz (124 tonne). IF (notice that is in uppercase), all of that was in JP Morgan's vault, that would represent 80% of the JP Morgan vault total. Yesterday's move of 6.86 tonne is only 6% of BofA's net stopped gold. How's that for an avalanche waiting to fall?

The numbers to the oz:

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Silver Vaults

A truckload (640 koz) was deposited at Loomis' vault and a half truckload departed Brinks for a net increase of 361 koz:

No change in registered, and even with 6 continuous days of no change in registered. That is no big deal.

I hear that yesterday one of my (blocked) trolls on Twitter is making a deal about there being 5 days of no change in registered silver. BFD. In fact, it is the 4th time **this year** that has occurred.  Even after yesterday's 6th day in a row of no change, a continuous 6 day span has happened **3 times this year**.

It's still about 10 days too early to look at the countdown to first notice on the July silver contract, however I can't help but notice that the OI decline is less than average:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atgitobcd16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e3d70dae95e6edc754db1b3bb6e117997dcade

This next plot is the daily change in OI ... essentially the derivative of the plot above. Note that the daily decline is running a couple of thousand contracts per day below average.

https://preview.redd.it/9cxkl8tdd16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=f30b6ba11498d193f4569daba0f8ba705a96491e

Meanwhile traders are flooding into the September contract causing a surge in total OI. See the plot below.

Note the blue line for the May 23 contract also experienced an OI surge at this point in the cycle. I'll have to think about why they are mirroring each other.

https://preview.redd.it/8fxlgoi1g16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45b37db55b061074291ccbba31deea21f3235e4

Yesterday the OI increase for the September contract (7,296) was more than double the decline for July (3,167). Usually, during the core of the roll, these are offsetting. The total OI increase is 4,382.

https://preview.redd.it/0irkrj49e16b1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd75b58dc3188094aec25ff0b3caafb8b09e54d6

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    comex vaults

Yesterday was ""take it away Tuesday"" at the comex vaults. One truckload (600 koz) departed JP Morgan and Loomis' vaults, 476 koz was out of Delaware Depository and 100 koz was out of CNT. All of that was somewhat offset by a 487 koz deposit at JP Morgan and 300 koz at Brinks.

The net change was 978 koz OUT OF THE VAULT:

https://preview.redd.it/ht16uy1nh16b1.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=a01f6d1361ea8579346c19f2e7841b9f18279476

&#x200B;

But that was nothing compared to gold.  Brinks' gold vault saw a 162 koz or 5.0 tonne departure. That is 3.4% of Brinks' vault total.

Scrolling back in time, Brinks had a 367 koz move out of registered on May 30, just a couple of weeks ago. That date was first notice day on the June contract so I have to try to pair that move with a gold buyer. However, nobody stopped that much gold, so I can't point the finger at anyone specifically. The largest buyer(s) that day were JP Morgan customer accounts at 353 koz ... fairly close. It is possible the vault move was JP Morgan customer account gold.

Here was the detail from that day:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely\_odd\_day\_for\_comex\_silver\_all\_just\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely_odd_day_for_comex_silver_all_just_to/)

Here we are 10 biz days later and 162 koz moves out of the vault. It's logical to connect those, although that is not certain. Perhaps that 5 tonne will show up at JP Morgan's vault or perhaps another large comex player is buying gold at comex, moving it out of registered and then OUT OF THE VAULT.

Asahi, the new vault, showed a 48 koz deposit.

JP Morgan,"Did JP Morgan Chase just get a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout to make it a bigger systemic risk so that the global financial system must bail them out?","Did JP Morgan Chase just get a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout to make it a bigger systemic risk so that the global financial system must bail them out? According to the list of global systemically important banks ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_systemically_important_banks), [Financial Stability Board (FSB)](https://www.fsb.org/2022/11/2022-list-of-global-systemically-important-banks-g-sibs/), [FSB PDF](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P211122.pdf)), JP Morgan Chase is top dog as the *only Tier 4* bank.  (The higher the tier, the more systemic risk the bank poses to the financial system so the required capital buffer is higher at each tier.)

>A systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis). They are colloquially referred to as ""[**too big to fail**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail)"". \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution)\]

According to the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements), which has a [dashboard](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/) showing scores and components for Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs), JP Morgan Chase is by itself in Tier 4 with the highest overall risk rating as the most interconnected bank with the most complex banking relationships.

***If*** **JP Morgan Chase were to fail, the financial system would be at high risk of a financial crisis.**  *Which means JPM Chase is in an interesting position because the global financial system is both incentivized to keep JPM from failing and, if an institution is to fail, putting the most complex and interconnected financial institution at risk* ***maximizes the likelihood of another bailout***.

Some of you may remember from 2 years ago (April 15, 2021) that JP Morgan sold $13B in bonds in the largest bank deal ever at the time ([SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt6bju/why_banks_randomly_decided_to_sell_billions_in/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/jpmorgan-to-sell-13-billion-of-bonds-in-largest-bank-sale-ever)) to raise money.  The next day, Bank of America takes the lead by selling $15B worth of bonds ([SuperStonk DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsioql/the_complete_bank_of_america_gamestop_dd/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/bofa-to-set-record-for-largest-bank-bond-sale-at-15-billion#xj4y7vzkg), April 16, 2021).

So if JP Morgan needed to raise some serious money *without getting a bailout*, buying another bank in a sweetheart deal seems like another way to juice up JP Morgan's balance sheet with some good PR. According to [CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/01/business/first-republic-purchase-hnk-intl/index.html),

>First Republic ... had assets of **$229.1 billion** as of April 13. As of the end of last year, it was the nation’s **14th-largest bank**, according to a ranking by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States with total global assets of **nearly $4 trillion** as of March 31.

Now that JP Morgan picked up First Republic, their total assets increases by about $229B (about 5.7%).  And, according to Reuters \[[Factbox](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-deal-collapsed-first-republic-explained-2023-05-01/)\], JP Morgan just got a pretty sweet deal with First Republic Bank:

* JPMorgan Chase will pay **$10.6 billion** to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC)
* Will **not** assume First Republic's corporate **debt** or preferred stock
* FDIC to provide [loss share agreements](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/) with respect to most acquired loans

So JP Morgan paid $10.6B to pick up $229B (less than 5c on the dollar), passes on the corporate debt, and shares losses with the FDIC so that:

* JPMorgan expects one-time gain of **$2.6 billion** post-tax at closing
* Estimated to add roughly **$500 million to net income** and be accretive to tangible book value per share

**That's a pretty damn good deal.**  Let's look more into what the FDIC says about [shared loss agreements (SLA)](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/jqe3z9ira9xa1.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=cefb80e4cb215985e0ac3c5836fe1c77316b7b7e)

The FDIC absorbs a portion of the loss on assets sold through resolving a failed bank ""sharing the loss with the purchaser of the failed bank"".  *Sounds like the FDIC just took one for the team.*

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/7qob3s6qb9xa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bfd02469344d43cef0f50540691e63c9c08b22a)

According to the FDIC, loss sharing is basically an 80/20 split (except for after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis when the split was 95/5, which has ended).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/alkxtvz6c9xa1.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d900e614b00abc103fb360936f421a708a047e2)

According to the FDIC, resolving a failed bank with loss sharing is supposed to be based on **the least costly option** (to the Deposit Insurance Fund).  (We've seen this least costly option come up in resolving bank failures before with the FDIC and Federal Reserve contemplating requiring Too Big To Fail banks sell destined-to-fail bonds to absorb losses and reduce payouts by the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund \[[SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/zdebh6/comment_against_the_federal_reserve_fdic_proposal/)\])

According to [Investopedia, JPMorgan To Pay FDIC $10.6 Billion For First Republic, This is What It Gets](https://www.investopedia.com/what-does-jpmorgan-get-in-first-republic-deal-7487296), resolving FRC bank failure will cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $13B.

>The FDIC will take a **$13 billion hit to its fund** and *provide $50 billion in financing*.

Wait, the **FDIC is providing $50B to finance JPM buying FRC?!**

https://preview.redd.it/4j4du9umk9xa1.png?width=3492&format=png&auto=webp&s=33069c143c5351f6b2e616e6c826fc543090e181

The FDIC loaned JP Morgan $50B to buy the failed First Republic bank for $10.6B.  $30B of that was used to repay a [rescue deal from March (last month)](https://www.investopedia.com/first-republic-s-usd30b-rescue-by-jp-morgan-citi-and-bank-of-america-7367932) backed by JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.  Which means JP Morgan gets their money back from the previous rescue *plus* an **extra $9.4B** out of this loan deal to buy $229B worth of assets from First Republic.

On top of that, JP Morgan splits losses with the FDIC 80/20 with the FDIC covering 80% of loan losses for the next 5-7 years (5 years for commercial loans and 7 years for residential mortgages).

**Imagine if a bank** ***loans you*** **$9,400 to buy a $229,000 house.**  No down payment.  Just ""here's $9,400 and the keys to that $229,000 house"". Oh, and the bank will cover 80% of the cost for anything that breaks in the house for the next 5-7 years.  *This is an insane deal.*

**Which truly makes one wonder if this is a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout for JP Morgan,** the *only* Tier 4 GSIB as the most interconnected bank with the most complex banking relationships and the highest overall systemic risk rating.

Are we going to see:

1. Fat bonuses at JP Morgan?
2. Followed by news about JP Morgan posing a systemic risk?
3. Followed by calls to bail out JP Morgan to save pensions?

This is exactly why anonymity and privacy is so important in crypto as a future of finance and potential TradFi and banking replacement/improvement, as well as the significance of decentralization 19 states have come out accusing JP Morgan of of closing accounts and discriminating against customers due to their political or religious beliefs. A letter to JP Morgan said ""the bank had canceled major organizations' checking accounts and  had asked screening questions focused on religion and politics before  reinstating them"" JPMorgan also allegedly declined a proposal on participation in a  survey for the Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index, which is meant to determine ""freedom of expression and freedom of religion or  belief as a standard part of doing business,"". JPMorgan had received a score of 15% for the index in 2022 which obviously shows their massive bias and give credibility to the claims.

It's significant enough that JP Morgan would randomly close accounts, and defenders would have said it's due to anti-money laundering politcies/bank secrecy act etc, absolutely ridiculous and makes their intentions clear when they ask questions that screen customers religious and political beliefs before customers have just a *chance* to get their accounts reinstated.

There's been a bit of a push and pull in crypto whereby some people disagree with the need to anonymity. I'd argue that these are privileged people who've had no issues with banks having their information, but they only had no issues because they had money, which the bank wanted. The government view of crypto regulation is definitely to peel back that anonymity as far back as they can. But this situation shows exaclly why anonymity is important, as it immediately solves problems of discrimination as well as safety of the individuals as well so as not to become target, either of societal or corporate discrimination, or criminals.

And crypto balances it very well with allowing *privacy* but not *confidentiality*. Privacy means a lack of direct intrusion into private or personal affairs, so an anonymous blockchain has privacy, but not confidentiality.  This as confidentiality deals more with a complete block of access to information like the government sealing documents and offering no access at all.

It also ties right back into decentralization, where no centralized entity has the power to deny access to services on the blockchain. We all know that power corrupts and JP Morgan has way too much of that. Instead we have a decentralized blockchain where it would take a (mostly) democratic process to deny access to services, and even then it's pretty rare.

Plus JP Morgan adds another truckload for the 5th day in a row. The upcoming inactive June silver contract's open interest continues to drift upwards despite the chaos on the gold contracts. It now stands at 1,120 contracts. Typically nearly all of the OI of these inactive month contracts stand for delivery. First notice day is in 7 days.

https://preview.redd.it/i2jsvm8o9u0b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=416b79e3fb992185b1478ed0ef595be4ed71ffb3

I've rarely mentioned the micro silver contract. The ticker is SIL and it is a 1,000 oz deliverable contract. A guy on twitter, [@EsScalping](https://twitter.com/EsScalping), pointed out that there is also an ""E-mini"" silver contract. That ticker is QI and is for 2,500 oz but is only financially settled. You can't get silver on QI so it'll never impact comex vault totals.

Back to the SIL 1,000 oz micro contract. I mentioned yesterday that what's been happening is the CME group is making a market in the SIL contract.

Essentially there are three fairly big buyers and no sellers. The CME folks buy metal on the 5,000 oz SI contract and sell it to those 3 players on the 1,000 oz SIL contract.

I should probably say, I'm referring to the physical market ... those that stand for delivery. There may be others trading paper contracts, but I can't identify them.  I'm addressing the names I see on the issues and stops report for physical metal.

The CME group has sold 21.44 million oz net since 2019 and those three customer accounts have bought 21.42 million oz. The cumulative net tally for each is as follows:

There's been a few bubbas that have occasionally stopped contracts, but you can see it is round off.

When the CME folks buy metal at the SI contract, it is essentially like some combination of these 3 customer accounts buying it. The metal just passes through, usually the same day.

Below are plots of the issues, stops and net for 1) the CME group, and 2) the largest buyer, Advantage customer accounts. Note that Advantage has rarely sold any silver.

I've considered adding the two contracts (SI and SIL) together for my graphics. The only reason I haven't is that the reader will have a difficult time tracking the raw numbers from the report to the graphs. Personally, I like to do that when viewing plots to gain confidence in the data. For now, I haven't added them. Currently, some of the larger issues and stops from the SIL contract are greater than the smaller, inactive months, on the SI contract. So I may start adding them for plots in the future.

Over lunch today I listened to a podcast that mentioned an increase in gold EFP (exchange for physical) volume. EFP's are a swap of a comex futures contract with a ""physical"" contract in London. Settlement by EFP rarely induces metal leaving London vaults.

As far as an EFP surge, I'm not seeing it. I track the cumulative EFP volume after zeroing the meter at day 44 (the start of the OI plateau). See the plot below. The June gold contract was riding the average line (the bold black line ) until recently and then drifted slightly below trend.

That said, the number of contracts that routinely vacate comex by EFP is huge. Usually it exceeds the total gold in registered as you can see below. The current registered gold is shown as the horizontal green line.

Another truckload arrived at JP Morgan's vault. That's a truckload in each of the last 5 days at JP Morgan's vault.

Yesterday I forgot to mention that the new vault operated by Asahi Depository, showed 1.2 million oz moved to registered and that is added to the comex vault registered total.

The day prior's statement for Asahi had all zeros. It was odd that their account statement didn't show metal being present the day before or being ""received"" on yesterday's report.  It just showed the ""adjustment"", which is the move to registered. Typically a move to registered has a deduct from eligible. Essentially, it just magically arrived.

Magic accounting. I wonder what's actually in Asahi's vault?

JP Morgan,📰 History Repeating – Jp Morgan & Rothschilds Redux,"📰 History Repeating – Jp Morgan & Rothschilds Redux **HISTORY REPEATING – JP MORGAN & ROTHSCHILDS REDUX** 

Little bit of a history of the gold/silver standard and what amounted to the Panic of 1896.  What’s interesting in this history lesson are the players and what they were trying to achieve – Rothschild and JP Morgan.  130 years later the same lessons are being told but the main players have not changed and the ultimate gain is banking as opposed to railway. 

JP Morgans undocumented manipulation of the gold and silver market has long been a speculated rumour and somewhat difficult thing to prove. So today we thought we’d take you on a journey back to 1895 – where speculation and government collusion were in fact tools used by JP Morgan and Rothschilds to both save the US from economic collapse and line their own pockets.  The result was the strengthening of these financial institutions, which over the years have used the same playbook to further enhance their market dominance and back-handed deals rewarding and not punishing their financial prowess.

The playbook? Wait for the government to fall into a panic or a financial crisis. Save the day. Manipulate markets to your advantage, and walk away with monopolistic powers.  In 1914 JP Morgan emerged as the major player and owner of railways in the US.  2023 JP Morgan emerges as the major player in US banking.  Both a mechanism of trade control – 1914 Industrial revolution trade control and 2023 banking and finance trade control.

**What’s a Panic?**

Rather than googling financial crisis – google panic, Pre-1900 the panic terminology appears to apply to any bubble or distorted market leading to market manipulation and panic, otherwise now known as a financial crisis.  Some examples include:

**Panic of 1819**

This was the first US widespread panic, driven by the end of the Napoleonic wars, it was compounded by asset bubbles in speculation in public lands – fueled by the unrestrained issue of ‘paper money’

**Panic of 1837**

Another panic set off from a real estate bubble and erratic American banking policy. Deflation set in with profit, prices and wages dropping.

**Panic of 1873**

This panic started in Europe with a stock market crash leading to investors liquidating bonds, in particular railway bonds in the US due to overdevelopment and speculation in railway.

**The Panic of 1893 and 1896**

Triggered by factors such as a failed coup in Argentina, a run on gold in the U.S. Treasury, and an oversupply of silver.

You see the gist here – gets a little 1800 repetitive and it was no wonder property prices remained fairly subdued throughout the 19th Century. It appears in the 20th Century, those Panic lessons may have been well and truly forgotten and the same old real estate lax banking bubbles emerged.

But for this history lesson we will focus on 1873 and 1893, and the great fortune JP Morgan was able to accumulate during this time and the role of gold and bonds that saw JP Morgan emerge as the US’s most powerful financial and railroad tycoon.

**Railroad Playbook**

JP Morgan cofounded Drexel, Morgan and company in 1871, becoming JP Morgan and company in 1895.  What seemed like a bad time to be in business turned out to be fortuitous to JP Morgan.  The Panic of 1873 started with the rampant inflation driven from overspeculation in railroads and the demonetization of silver in Germany and the US.  Following the American Civil War, 33,000 miles of railroad were built between 1868 and 1873.  Within the railroad craze a large infusion of cash was raised via bonds.  In 1871 Germany demonetized silver leading to an oversupply of silver, particularly in the US who mined most of the supply.  In 1873 the US passed the Coinage Act of 1873 backing the US dollar to a de facto gold standard.   This immediately depressed silver prices further, reduced money supply and raised interest rates hurting farmers.  People then shied away from long term bonds and collapsed the railway bond market.

In 1873 the precipice of the Panic happened when Jay Cooke and Company couldn’t sell millions of dollars of Northern Pacific Railway Bonds leading to its bankruptcy. By 1874 60 railroads had gone bankrupt 

In 1875 Congress backed the USD with gold helping to curb and stabilize the dollar.

It was 10 years after the collapse in railway bonds that JP Morgan emerged as a railway force, this time reorganizing railways, merging them and taking stakes, such as in 1885 when he arranged a merger between New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad.  

**Morgan-Belmont Syndicate**

Following the 1893 Panic, paper money was being exchanged for gold from treasury, draining the US Treasury of gold.  The hot money movement as it was later known had all the hallmarks of a self compelling bank run on Treasury due to a distrust of the US government’s gold reserve.  There was a rapid decline in gold reserves from $121,0000,000 on January 1st 1893 to $66,000,000 on February 1st 1894.  Under these circumstances the government used 4 subscriptions of $50,000,000 of 5% 10 year bonds over a 1894-1895.  But each time treasury again saw gold continue to pour out of treasury.  Speculative international transactions prompted by the fear of the ceasing of the gold standard saw another net outflow of $84,000,000 between October 1894 and January 1895, investors were liquidating bank balances and railroad bonds for gold and sending this gold to Europe at an increasing rate.

To assist with the US predicament a famous meeting between President Cleveland and JP Morgan in 1895 produced a syndicate and its contract on February 8th 1895.  The contract failed to name syndicate members with a veil of secrecy, although it is now known the syndicate included both Rothschilds and JP Morgan to name some of the more notable firms.  The contract was for the syndicate to bolster gold stock and stop outflows. The syndicate agreed to purchase 3,500,000 ounces of gold and sell it to the government with 4% 30 year bonds.  

The syndicate acquired $62,315,400 in government bonds at a 4% return, which they sold at 3 ¾% almost immediately for $68,833,591 – a tidy $5,000,000 immediate profit. Additional to the gold they delivered, within a week the syndicate saw other gold inflows of $10,000,000 from domestic holders.

The second condition was the syndicate exert control on the market (manipulate) to stop gold outflows.  The syndicate contract lasted 6 months, with the Syndicate manipulating control over the exchange rate to ensure enhanced profits from the arrangements

*‘The unique and imprecise manner by which authority was delegated by the government to a private syndicate to control the foreign-exchange market would be unthinkable in modern time’*

During this time it was also identified that the syndicate used moral suasion (more manipulation) to ensure other gold holders/investors did not withdraw further gold.  They appealed to these investors by giving bonds at preferential terms they would adhere to the ‘ship no gold’ agreement. Articles at the time supported the Syndicate and the moral suasion such as the United States Investor revered the Syndicate for stopping the previous deflation 

‘*To those persons to criticize the bond syndicate for keeping the price of the exchange at such high figures, it is sufficient to say that had the Syndicate not intervened, the cost of paying debts cold be even greater than at present, because gold would be in transit instead of exchange.’*

The Syndicate succeeded in reinvigorating faith in the US government and dollar and saw a period of prosperity follow, but it seems from this point the US Government owed the architects of the syndicate a favour.   And it appears during this time the Syndicate learnt the economic benefits of precious metal manipulation.

The end of the agreement saw Europe liquidate some of these railway bonds, which we’re sure became the icing on JP Morgans Railway cake as he emerged in 1902 as the largest US railway owner, controlling 5,000 miles of US railroads.

**JP Morgan and First Republic Bank today**

We all know this more recent story of JP Morgans takeover of multiple banks – Bear Sterns, First Republic Bank with the government again leaning on the financial Behemoth to help save the US dollar.  But just like in 1895 the favors and profits to be made are enhancing both the strength and influence of JP Morgan. 

During the First Republic deal laws were broken and profits were made, putting JP Morgan in a stronger monopolistic position in US banking, just like the railways in 1902.

The US law that needed to be circumvented, as JPMorgan ‘*is so big that by* **law it would not be allowed to buy First Republic** *because no one bank can have more than a 10 per cent market’*

And the profit made by JP Morgan: *‘Recognize an upfront, one-time, post-tax gain of approximately $2.6 billion, which does not reflect the approximately $2.0 billion dollars of post-tax restructuring costs anticipated over the next 18 months’*

History Repeats.

**Finally just a little bit of 2023/1873 comparison**

* 1998 tech boom leading to the 2000 collapse- with overinvestment and hype in a new technology – railway vs internet (Panic of 1873)
* 2008 Financial Crisis and deflation (Panic of 1895)
* And finally 2022 inflation, 14 years after the GFC, bought on by Covid, compared  the 1917  during and proceeding World War 1. With inflation in 1920 hitting 25% and 1921 a sharp reversal -15% so will we see a similar pattern in 2024/2025?

JP Morgan,14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect.,"14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect. Excuse me ... change that headline to registered vault. No hyperbole intended. On with the show ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A huge move, 14.7 tonne or 471,000 oz, is out of registered gold on today's vault report ... all of it out of JP Morgan's vault.

Often, but not always, metal moved out of registered ends up being moved out of the vault soon thereafter. Time will tell on that. Regardless, it is a move away from being sold at comex. The size of the move is noteworthy.

Inquiring minds want to know ... who did it? Obviously, it could be any of the comex players who had 14.7 tonne or more in JP Morgan's vault. But that rules out a lot of entities.

I can guess who may be on that short list based on who bought gold recently from JP Morgan or JP Morgan customer accounts. If they stopped metal from those players, the gold would reside in JP Morgan's vault.

Recall that on March 30 of this year JP Morgan issued delivery notices on 10,682 gold contracts. That's 33.2 tonne of gold. I'm talking the house account. The bank. They had shorted gold like f'ing hell during the $150 March rally in an attempt to defend the cabal's fiat. If they hadn't gold would have gone up a lot more than $150.

Here's the procedure to guess who removed the metal: 

Since the metal is in JP Morgan's vault, I looked at all the gold sold by JP Morgan and its customer accounts only. Scrolling back through time, those entities sold 320,000 oz or 3.82 tonne from March 31 onward ... not enough to source today's vault departure.

In other words, if this is metal was bought recently, it would have to include part of the 33.2 tonne sold by JP Morgan's house account on March 30. 

That's extremely interesting. That was an epic sale by JP Morgan. It was the largest sale ever for them, and now it may be involved in metal moving out of comex.

Next, I looked at who stopped (bought) that 33.2 tonne JP Morgan sold on March 30. While you typically don't know which short's metal went to which long, in this case JP Morgan accounted for 63% of the gold sold that day, so you can guess that the big buyers that day got a sizable piece of JP Morgan's metal.

Below are the players who stopped more than one tonne that day. The primary suspects from this list are BofA, Citi and Morgan Stanley customer accounts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvybhgpmmv1b1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ce5df2dab1943e86ebd5c9cda8807312bc168b

Next I looked at all the ***net*** metal stopped since March 30 by all comex players. This would be from any and all sellers. See the list below. Note that some of this metal may have been acquired from non-JP Morgan sellers, but it would be near impossible to screen further to who stopped metal from only JP Morgan's vault.

https://preview.redd.it/exdzw80fnv1b1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=56832df2c8b05b5875e7984557805b7f5a5634d2

Note that Citi isn't on the list as they sold all of the metal bought on March 30 (plus another 5%). So Citi is off the suspect list and the list is down to 2.

Morgan Stanley customers acquired 8.1 tonne on March 30 and another 1.8 tonne after March 30. Their accrued net purchase since March 30 is 9.9 tonne. It IS possible that they moved their newly bought 9.9 tonne plus another 4.8 tonne they had bought previously, but this is less likely. Furthermore, this all assumes that Morgan Stanley customers are all acting together, or are (mostly) one entity.  I think they are a long shot.

That leaves BofA. What about them?

BofA stopped 13.6 tonne on March 30 and another 16.9 tonne since for a total of 30.5 tonne. Furthermore, they haven't sold **any** gold at all over the last 4 months which is an indication of the direction of their intent ... not flipping metal. The accumulated gold bought since March 30 far surpasses today's vault move of 14.7 tonne. They are the lead suspect.

Who'dve thunk. It wasn't Putin or Xi after all.

The possibility that one of comex's biggest gold players is buying metal and removing it from (at least) registered, is significant. BofA has bought a net 125 tonne since becoming active in early 2021. If this 14.7 tonne is their metal, that would be 12% of their stack.  And maybe more is going out!

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Silver Vaults

JP Morgan did NOT move a truckload into the vaults today, unlike the prior 7 days. Perhaps their silver stack rebuild is complete at 4.2 million oz. If so, that is nothing like the volumes they could effortlessly deliver with the click of the mouse, like 30 million oz at a time. That was before they were downgraded to jay pee pee.

A net 340,000 oz is out of the vault and 400,000 oz was moved out of registered at JP Morgan's vault. BofA?

The June inactive month silver contract is counting down to first notice day with 5 (biz) days to go. The OI has stabilized at 1,133 contracts or about 5.5 million oz. Just noticing that the SIL contract (the 1,000 oz micro) has about 1.2 million oz ready to stand for delivery too.

Back to just the SI contract ... while that OI plots as near the average of prior contracts (shown below on the countdown plot), it is much greater than recent months.

Plus, as a fraction of registered silver, it's one of the highest months over the last 3 years. At the current OI, it accounts for 18.5% of registered whereas the average inactive month (at day 5) is 7.3%:

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold

Gold contracts continue to close with the total OI declining 6,192 contracts. Based on recent price activity, you'd assume this is being driven by longs closing contracts.

The June contract is now rolling to August, so I track the OI with the sum of the two:

Based on the June countdown plot, it would appear that of the roll pair contracts (June and August) most of the reduction is in the August contract. I say that because the June contract is 16,000 below the mean, whereas the sum of the two is 39,000 below the mean. The June contract OI is as follows:

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver Vaults

For the 7th day in a row a truckload was received at JP Morgan's vault. If you've not yet been enlightened, a truckload in my jargon is 600,000 oz. A lot of comex silver moves in lots of 600k. That is also a typical payload that can be moved by most class 8 trucks in the USA. Converted to lbs that is 41,000. And for you people that haven't yet converted, that is 18,800 kilos.

So that is now 4.2 million oz of newly arrived metal at JP Morgan's vault over the last 7 days. This is not unlike JP Morgan's restocking of 30 tonne of gold with 6 deposits between March 31 and May 2.

Today, however, the 600k oz deposit at JP Morgan was offset by a 1.1 million oz move out of the vault. Furthermore, 35,000 oz was transferred out of registered at JP Morgan's vault.

For the totals of all 10 comex vaults,  600k was moved in, 2.5 million oz was moved out for a net decline of 1.9 million oz. Also 280,000 oz was moved out of registered to eligible.

The gold vaults saw 1 even tonne move into Brinks:

The comex gold contracts had another large reduction in open interest dropping by 10,886 contracts. Give it a yawn. That is typical for this point in the cycle (2 days to first notice).  Basically, there are a lot of folks who hang around with about 5 or 6 days to go who are not hedgers. They are arbs or folks trying to pick up some fiat as the herd rolls or closes. They just close without rolling.

The raw numbers:

That 10,886 decline drops the OI well below the pre-OI surge level from about 3 weeks ago:

https://preview.redd.it/xjbmrdinq92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6adea51f149847d74ad0d99d96b7581023a865f

Currently we are in the last days of the roll period from the June contract to the August contract. See the OI countdown plot below. The number of contracts that closed on the June contract was 42,498 which is exactly the average.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8xkqppht92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=aced6c293570491b5b3faa1f8cb908fc879e22ac

What happened, and almost always happens at this point, is that many of those contracts didn't roll to August. They just closed. The new August contracts totaled 31,219 or 11,279 less. However, this 11,279 is routine for day 2. In fact usually it is even greater at 14,500.

&#x200B;

The June contract OI is now 58% of registered metal in the vault:

https://preview.redd.it/wr5tgow8t92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e979180681727b76d38dc43ce874581637c24fb

Moving on the the gold vaults ...  the story at JP Morgan's vault is more bizarre. There was an additional 242,611 oz (or 7.5 tonne) moved out of JP Morgan's vault. This time the move was from the 400 oz vault.

You may recall the March 2020 near crack up at comex. In an effort to add physical supply, comex changed its rules such that contracts could be settled with 400 oz bars in addition the the usual 100 oz bars. An additional category was added to the vault report specifically for the 400 oz bars.

Considering all of comex (not just JP Morgan), as of yesterday's report only 242,611 oz or 2% of comex registered gold consisted of 400 oz bars. That gives some indication of how many settlements consist of 400 oz bars. Eligible gold consisted of 3,895,686 oz (or 35%) in 400 oz bars.

Therefore, this 242,611 oz move from registered to eligible zeros out comex registered in the 400 oz bar category.

&#x200B;

Was that 242,611 oz move on today's report also BofA?   Over the two prior days BofA (at least it is a high probability it was BofA) moved 18.3 tonne out of JP Morgan's registered (in the 100 oz vault). I'd bet that it was BofA which would bring their 3 day move out of registered to 25.9 tonne.

Moving on to other vault changes ... there was also a 250,778 oz (7.8 tonne) move *into* registered at JP Morgan's vault.

Since that is all getting complicated, I'll cut and paste the raw report for the JP Morgan portion of the vault report:

&#x200B;

I doubt that BofA is moving metal out of, and then back into, registered. So I don't think this is connected to the discussion above. I suspect that we will see someone issue 2,510 contracts early next week.  I'll wait until then to see who's name is printed on the issues and stops report. I have a premonition who that may be.

&#x200B;

Other vault moves ... one tonne into MTB's vault. And the net of all that is ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver

First notice day on the June inactive silver contract is also Monday. FYI ... FND of gold and silver contracts are always synced. The June silver open interest continues flat at 1,114 contracts or 5.57 million oz. Another 1.34 million oz is about to stand for delivery on the micro contract for a total of 6.91 million oz. That'll require 23% of the registered silver.

Speaking of the vault, registered dropped below 30 million oz again. 600 k is out of registered at MTB and 300 k out at HSBC.

The new vault, Asahi, showed 600 k oz arriving with a small offset of 55 k oz departing. The net of all that is ...

Another big day at the gold vaults. There was followup from yesterday's huge move with an additional 118,000 oz or 3.7 tonne moving out of registered at JP Morgan's vault. That is on top of yesterday's 471,000 oz or 14.7 tonne bringing the 2 day total to 18.3 tonne. 

So far, none of that metal has left the vault ... according to the vault reports.

In yesterday's piece, I showed analysis that points the finger at BofA for being the responsible party. You gotta read daily as I can't keep a post concise and repeat the relevant history: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147\_tonne\_vacates\_jp\_morgans\_comex\_gold\_vault/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147_tonne_vacates_jp_morgans_comex_gold_vault/)

These new vault withdrawal numbers are completely consistent with my BofA guess. In fact, strengthens the BofA case because the alternatives had bought much less than BofA recently. Yesterday I mentioned that there is a lot more where that came from ... and there still is.

Separately, there was a 7.0 tonne deposit at Malca Amit's vault. That is a 35% increase. I don't have any recon on who that could be, but I suspect their name will be on the issues and stops report on Monday.

The upcoming June gold contract is an active month and with first notice day on Monday. The OI trajectory has been declining less than usual the last few days as you can see in the plot below.

Usually the number of contracts standing for delivery ranges from 10-20%. Apparently the gold vaults are managed with more cushion than the silver vaults. Why? Probably because a delivery miss on gold would be game over.

&#x200B;

The daily change in OI of the front month contract is shown below. It's the derivative of the plot above. Note that today's trading, day 2 before first notice day, usually has the largest decline in OI.

As the June contract appears at the average (bold black line) on the first plot, when adjusted for the reduction in registered gold, the OI is one of the higher contracts. The June contract has 95% of registered gold compared to the average of 75%.

The OI on the June silver contract, an inactive month, is holding around 1,120 contracts. Traders generally don't roll on inactive month contracts which is why the OI isn't plunging like the active month gold contract.

JP Morgan,Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank,"Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are helping the Ukrainian government set up a reconstruction bank to steer public seed capital into rebuilding projects that can attract hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment.

The Ukraine Development Fund remains in the planning stages and is not expected to fully launch until the end of hostilities with Russia. But investors will have a preview this week at a London conference co-hosted by the British and Ukrainian governments.

“So many of today’s long-term challenges are best addressed through blended finance and this is one. You need these vehicles to mobilise capital at scale,” said BlackRock vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand, who will be discussing the work on Wednesday.

The World Bank estimated in March that Ukraine would need $411bn to rebuild after the war, and recent Russian attacks have driven that figure higher.

The Kyiv government engaged BlackRock’s consulting arm in November to determine how best to attract that kind of capital, and then added JPMorgan in February. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced last month that the country was working with the two financial groups and consultants at McKinsey.

No formal fundraising target has been set but people familiar with the discussions say the fund is seeking to raise low-cost capital from governments, donors and international financial institutions and leverage it to attract between five and 10 times as much private investment.

BlackRock and JPMorgan are donating their services, although the work will give them an early look at possible investments in the country. The assignment also deepens JPMorgan’s relationship with a longstanding client. The bank has helped Ukraine raise more than $25bn in sovereign debt since 2010 and led the country’s $20bn debt restructuring last year.

The financiers consulted with private and public sector investors and found they wanted to help Ukraine but were leery not just about war losses but also the country’s governance, lack of transparency and shallow capital markets.

What Ukraine needed, BlackRock advised, was a development finance bank to find investment opportunities in sectors such as infrastructure, climate and agriculture and make them attractive to pension funds and other long-term investors and lenders. JPMorgan was brought in partly for its debt expertise.

“The fund is being set up to also give public and private sector investors the opportunity to invest into specific projects and sectors,” said Stefan Weiler, JPMorgan’s head of debt capital markets for central Europe, Middle East and Africa. “There will be different sectoral funds that the fund identified as priorities for Ukraine. The aim is maximise capital participation.”

The structure calls for the fund to use the lower-cost public money, known as concessional capital, to make initial investments and absorb the first losses.

The notion is that this initial seed capital would be a de-risking mechanism, and it would create the potential for private sector capital to come in at scale,” said Brandon Hall, co-head of BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory arm. “Ukraine will have its own organisation to source and syndicate these local investment opportunities.”

To overcome investor concerns about governance, the fund is expected to stock its board with representatives of international financial institutions and governments and hire investment professionals to execute its strategy.

“Our view is that if you have a strong governance structure and an internationally credible set of stakeholders who are in the leadership position in this fund, then that will go a long way,” Hall said",0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,https://on.ft.com/443yCpg,06/20/2023,06:27:00,DoYouWant_the_Cheese,21,Asia

JP Morgan is almost certainly restocking the silver vault with a third day in a row of a truckload deposit. Plus Degen ""erisorto"" wins the prize. Yesterday I was writing about the roll period where traders close their position on an upcoming active month contract and open a position in the next active month contract. A high fraction of contracts roll forward as such.

Furthermore, near the start of the roll period, there is a large increase in the number of TAS contracts on both the outgoing and incoming contracts. Basically, traders often utilize the trade at settlement (TAS) alternative to close and/or open their positions.

Below is a plot of the TAS volume for each contract. Focus on the pink shaded ""outgoing"" TAS period around day 17 to 8 days to first notice.

It's not readily apparent on the above plot, but the TAS surge almost always lasts 5 continuous business days. Furthermore, it never starts on a Wednesday.

The question I asked was ... why doesn't the TAS surge start on Wednesdays?

FYI ... below are the stats on the start of the 5 day surge:

https://preview.redd.it/vzdenod4wf0b1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e04b0042f57f51528efc32e2f2f9e4b1253d7b

Of the 12,500 degenerates who read yesterday's post, only 1 person figured that out.

Aaaand the winner is ""erisorto"" of the SilverDegenClub:

https://preview.redd.it/ff9an4ydwf0b1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=427333350efa3556ba4ff6f365e2ae08816323f1

To add some commentary to erisorto's comments ...  a couple of months back, the sum total of the 5 day TAS surge was a lot less than usual. I thought I could then look at the CoT and see which category of trader had declined by comparing two subsequent CoT reports. If there was some correlation, that could infer which type of trader exploits TAS during those 5 days.

I then realized that that particular 5 day TAS period spanned 2 CoT reports. That fuzzes up the numbers because you then have to look at three subsequent reports to determine the changes.  It fuzzed things up enough that it wasn't apparent which category was involved.

I looked back through time and ALL of the TAS surge numbers spanned 2 reports. What a coincidink!

FYI ... the CoT report is based on traders position at the end of trading on Tuesday (and posted on Friday). The only way to get a clean week to week change between just 2 reports would be if the TAS surge started on a Wednesday. And that's why it never starts on Wednesday!

Everyone will want to start pointing fingers at the CME folks. However, note that the exchange has no rules or guidance about when to roll, or whether to use TAS or not. It's the traders themselves who decide. Apparently, the vast majority of traders decide to not roll their own position on Wednesdays. Furthermore, they mostly avoid Tuesday and Thursday because that splits the change at a 4:1 ratio (or 1:4). By rolling on Monday or Friday, the change is split by a 3:2 (or 2:3) for maximum obfuscation and that is what they do 75% of the time.

The traders are obfuscating data about themselves. The core driver of this is the weekly schedule of the CoT report with positions reported from the Tuesday close. It would be interesting to see if the CFTC required traders to report, say, twice a week. Would the traders modify their 5 day TAS surge?

Congrats to erisorto.  Comex traders have been parading him around the comex pits all day. He's got an interview on CNBC set for tomorrow morning at the opening bell, plus a visit to the White House later in the week.

And on with the new stuff:

Yesterday I wrote about the gold open interest surging ahead by 14,416 contracts on Monday and how that invited a (price) beat down. Although, when I wrote that, the beat down was in progress (on Tuesday). What I didn't know was the beat down reversed that entire OI increase, dropping OI by 14,189 contracts.

One of the larger OI increases immediately followed by one of the larger reductions:

What happened with silver? The Tuesday smack down did drive a few longs out of the May silver contract ... just 22 contracts. But a near offsetting number (18) opened June contracts as you can see below. This may seem like small potatoes but between the tail of the May contract and the upcoming June contract,  7-1/2 million oz will need delivered shortly. The June contract is an inactive month and typically all of those dudes hang around for delivery.

The shorts on the May contract continue to not deliver metal ... zero delivery notices last night. Eight days left to deliver.

# The firm’s market access controls failed to prevent five erroneous orders routed to exchanges and alternative trading systems:

* On January 30, 2019, a firm trader on the Program Trading Agency Desk routed to the market an order to purchase 50,000 shares of an equity security. 
   * The trader intended to enter a limit price of $268.50, but mistakenly input $286.50. 
   * The firm received executions with prices over 5% higher than the last execution in the market prior to entry of this order. 
   * The firm submitted clearly erroneous filings and approximately half of the 50,000-share order (executions above $276.57) were busted. 
* On July 26, 2019, a client entered a market order to sell 86,500 equity shares instead of the intended limit order. 
   * A trader accepted the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The last share price at the time of order entry was $27.23. 
   * The firm received executions at prices down to $22.25, representing an approximately 18% drop. 
* On December 19, 2019, instead of entering a limit-on-close order, a firm trader on the Equity Finance Trading Desk erroneously entered a limit order to buy 230,000 shares of an equity security at $154.17. 
   * The firm routed the order to the market and received executions with prices up to $154.17, which was approximately 3% higher than the prior execution price at order entry of $149.52. 
   * The firm filed a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $154.01 were busted. 
* On March 26, 2020, a client entered a pairs order in the firm’s system. 
   * While a firm algorithm was handling the order, a control paused the order for manual review. 
   * After the review and the resumption of the order, the algorithm handling the order did not refresh the market data to account for the pause. 
   * In less than one minute, the system routed to various execution venues over 80,000 immediate-or-cancel orders, which the execution venues canceled back unfilled because they were priced away from the prevailing market. 
* On April 22, 2021, a client entered a market order to buy 4,765 equity shares but intended to buy 50 shares at a limit price of $4,765. 
   * The Electronic Client Solutions Desk received the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The firm received executions with prices up to $5,077.30, which was approximately 6% higher than the last traded price of $4,799.99. 
   * The firm submitted a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $4,903.50 were busted. 

# The firm’s erroneous order and duplicative order controls were not reasonably designed:  

* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied fixed single order quantity limits ranging from 100,000 to 9,999,999 shares depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client involved in each order. 
   * The firm also applied static single order notional value limits ranging from $25,000,000 to $500,000,000 depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client. Each of these single order quantity and single order notional value limits applied static limits regardless of security and thus failed to consider the individual characteristics of the security. 
   * The firm further applied average daily volume limits ranging from 25 to 50 percent based on the specific desk, trader, and/or client.
   *  With the exception of one desk’s single order quantity control, the firm’s single order quantity, single order notional value, and average daily value thresholds were too large to be effective, and the firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set them at such levels.
* Moreover, many of the above referenced size controls triggered “soft blocks” when applicable thresholds were reached. 
   * In contrast to a “hard block,” which generally prevents an order from being submitted by automatically rejecting it, a soft block pauses an order until the block is overridden or the order is cancelled back or modified. 
      * For most of the relevant period, however, the firm’s written supervisory procedures did not address how to handle, document, and review soft block overrides. 
      * Accordingly, the firm’s controls that relied on soft blocks did not prevent the entry of certain erroneous orders. 
      * By January 2021, the firm implemented changes to its supervisory requirements relating to soft blocks that included tracking and reviews of soft block overrides and adding compliance trainings and updates to its written supervisory procedures on the handling of soft blocks.
* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied single order limit price controls based on fixed percentages away from the National Best Bid and Offer, ranging from three to 15 percent depending on the desk, trader, and/or client involved. 
   * Like the firm’s size controls, certain limit price thresholds were set too high to be effective. 
   * In particular, the limit price controls generally exceeded the numerical guidelines for clearly erroneous transactions. 
   * The firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set its limit price thresholds at levels greater than the definition of a clearly erroneous transaction. 
      * Additionally, for the same reasons previously noted above, the firm’s supervisory system for soft blocks was deficient for most of the relevant period. 
      * In October 2020, the firm began introducing a price control that applied different thresholds to differently priced securities.  
* Furthermore, the firm did not have a reasonable duplicative order control. 
   * The firm did apply a risk control that checked orders with the same symbol, side, and quantity. 
   * This control triggered a hard block if more than 50,000 order messages with the same symbol, side, and quantity were sent within two seconds. 
   * However, the 50,000-order threshold, which was applied separately to each of the firm’s connections to external venues, was too high to be effective. 
   * The firm provided no documented rationale supporting why such a high threshold was reasonable. 

As of July 2022, the firm had implemented additional controls to prevent the entry of orders that—based on price and/or size of the order relative to the market—could potentially lead to unintended market impact.

>Yet, in addition to close associates of Wexner, Dimon’s coronation as one of the most powerful bankers in the country was also made possible thanks to another powerful clan that also shares close connections to Wexner – the Crown family of Chicago. Perhaps even more than Wexner, the Crowns are a testament to how the worlds of organized crime and corporate power have mixed over the years to produce elites who are truly untouchable. With a long-standing dominant role in the American military-industrial complex as well as other facets of the corporate world, the Crowns have a history of doing what’s necessary – whether legal or illegal – to get what they want to advance their political agendas and grow their own power. Even presidents and the Pentagon have been unable to successfully challenge them. As this article will show, the Crowns – perhaps more than any other group – are a critical part of the story of how Jame Dimon became the king of Wall Street.

Plus, JP Morgan has now nearly restocked its gold vault after dumping 33.5 tonne of gold $200 ago. That's the ""smart"" money! After a huge 3 day surge followed by a one day drop, the total gold contract open interest has settled into normalcy. The June contract is now a few days into the roll period as that contract's OI is falling and the roll month of August is increasing.

Typically there is a total OI increase during this portion of the roll, so today's total OI increase of 3,166 is normal compared to the average of 3,570. You can see the OI cycle below where the solid black line is the arithmetic average:

Let's talk silver!

The upcoming June contract's OI has increased to 981, or about 4.9 million oz, and is much higher than recent months. This is an inactive month and typically, these contracts stay open and take delivery. You can see that in the flat bold black average line which stays mostly flat during the run up to first notice day. That's in sharp contrast to the active months where OI is plunging toward FND. Real men buy inactive months ... apparently.

That 4.9 million oz is 18% of registered vault totals. If you think of it relative to the registered vault total, suddenly the June contract OI is almost twice the average inactive month. See the plot below.

Perhaps that's why some silver is arriving at the vaults lately.

JP Morgan,"We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan?","We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan? Microstrategy has an insane plan. It's wildly complex and super intricate. After much analysis I have concluded the following:

When BTC goes up, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC goes down, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC crabs, MS buys Bitcoin

When Michael Saylor is sued, MS buys Bitcoin

It may be a bit hard to follow but I can dumb in down for you: MS buys Bitcoin.

I even made a joke of it here, and I think we generally view MS as on 'our side' but MS currently owns around 140,000 BTC which is about 0.72% of circulating supply. It's doesn't sound like *that* much but it's pretty close to close to an entire 1%. In fact, it's almost certain that they will own more than 1% of the total supply at the end of all this. And that percentage is deceiving because we don't know how many BTC is permanently burned, but it's likely quite a lot, so the actual percentage they'll own will be even greater. Chainalysis estimates that up to 20% of the Bitcoin already issued may be permanently lost, which means they own more like 0.9% of what's left.

To put their buys into perspective, in just 2 years since March 2021, they managed to purchase 0.25% of circulating supply. Estimates have put the final Bitcoin to be mined in 2140. Of course, most of us won't be alive, but if MS continues at current rates, they'll have another 2.5% of supply in just 10 years. This is a hard estimate as their are many factors to this but it's fair enough I think. Imagine how much they'll earn in 30 years alone, when we would have all grown old(er).

I don't think we'll look at then the way we do now.",0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12fz6jg/we_encourage_and_laugh_with_microstrategy_now_but/,04/09/2023,02:35:43,OneThatNoseOne,324,Asia

JP Morgan,JP Morgan Chase earnings report,"JP Morgan Chase earnings report The 2023 Q2 earnings report for JPMorgan Chase has just been released. Overall, the ER is a remarkable demonstration of the durability and power of the top bank. JPM's results, both top and bottom line, exceeded market forecasts. The fact that the bank declared a solid balance sheet during and after a highly tumultuous time for the banking industry is, in my opinion, more significant.   
The last one or two quarters have been described by certain media as the most difficult for banks since the 2008 crisis. JPM was able to keep a healthy standardised CET1 capital ratio of 13.8% even after the First Republic deal. J.P. Morgan was able to negotiate a favourable price because they were the only reliable buyer for FRC. In a back-of-the-envelope analysis of the transaction, Matt Levine of Bloomberg noted how J.P. Morgan receives good upside and regulatory protection while sharing a large portion of the potential losses if the loans default. Although the estimated $500 million in annual net income for the agreement is small in comparison to the $40 billion or so they already generate, it demonstrates that a bank like JPMorgan can take advantage of the crisis.  
The bank currently has $1.4 trillion in cash and short-term securities, which is a lot of liquidity. I have no doubt that JPM will be able to fulfil these new standards and keep its fortress balance sheet, even though there may be some capital changes and liquidity in the near future as the banking industry adapts to new rules.  
Given the current instability in the banking industry, regulatory standards may be modified in various ways. With Basel III's completion, Dimon himself anticipates ""material changes"" to capital and liquidity. He continued by issuing a warning that the market as a whole as well as end customers would probably be affected by these regulatory changes in the real world.

JP Morgan,Registered silver continues to drain with another truckload out of registered at Brinks. JP Morgan's gold vault sees 5 tonne hasta la vaulta. That is 3% of their vault total.,"Registered silver continues to drain with another truckload out of registered at Brinks. JP Morgan's gold vault sees 5 tonne hasta la vaulta. That is 3% of their vault total. &#x200B;

Following up from last week's analysis, the July contract continues adding net new contracts for immediate delivery. Friday saw 32 move contracts tacked on or 160,000 koz. The cumulative after 5 days is 402 contracts or 2.01 million oz or 5.8% of registered silver.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syii3vhe17bb1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd535a20564b936aed1d04018e6614108bf1eb1

At the silver vaults one even truckload was removed from Brinks' vault. That is 3 days in a row where one even truckload was moved out of registered. I'd surmise that this party is whoever bought part of the 12 million oz sold by Standard Chartered (and delivered out of Brinks' vault). Only 3 parties were issued more than 1.8 million oz that day ...

&#x200B;

* JP Morgan customer accounts -    6.070 million oz
* BofA                                                   2.565 million oz
* Morgan Stanley house account - 2.225 million oz.

Time may tell, or at least indicate, who is moving metal out of registered. It all 12 million oz moves out, that'd be 17 more truckloads.  And, for the record, I'm not predicting that.

&#x200B;

I thought it was odd that silver was moving out of registered in 600 koz batches even thought it hasn't (yet) moved out of the vault. I've documented that silver moves in or out of the vault in 600 koz tranches, but moves from registered to eligible or versa vice could be different.

I don't know if vaults segregate registered from eligible. If it was just a digital reassignment, you'd think they could change status of any amount of silver with just a click the mouse. If they actually move the metal, there could be size considerations to change status.

Curiosity got the best of me and I did the stats. Moves in and out of registered ARE more frequent than most other size moves except small moves (-250,000 to +50,000).  See the histogram below.

And those are thousands of oz on the x-axis:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7cctiwwh67bb1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d58f74518c3bbdb4fbf4f17158bc07e26f69cb5

But if you consider the percentage of total oz moved, the truckload size change jumps out:

https://preview.redd.it/sc55raxna7bb1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd21a233c2f840bda40cd4f36d7bd5a552f571e

It's possible that there are moves into or out of registered in 600 koz lots only because it arrives or departs the vaults in those sizes. I'm saying that because often silver moves in or out of the vault occur before or soon after the change from registered. To get to the bottom of that, I'd have to strip out moves that weren't associated with a move in or out of the vault. Ain't doing that right now. Maybe someday.

At the end of all that ... I don't know why these 3 Brinks' moves have been 3 sequential 600 koz changes and the metal remains in eligible.

MTB also moved 100 koz out of registered:

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold Vaults

JP Morgan's vault sees 5 even tonne (160 koz) moved out of the vault. That is 3.1% of that vaults total silver. Depository Services of Delaware also sees 12 koz depart.

&#x200B;

The JP Morgan withdrawal isn't connected to any recent moves from registered. The last move exceeding 5 tonne from JP Morgan's registered was May 23, or 34 biz days ago.

Perhaps their recent gold vault build will be reversed:

JP Morgan,"JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz.","JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz. The total of JP Morgan's vault of registered silver has dwindled from over 40 million oz at the start of the silver squeeze to 8.1 million oz.

The JP Morgan vault would be the total of JP Morgan, the bank's silver, and customer silver. Typically JP Morgan's house account doesn't keep much silver in registered so this move out today is likely silver owned by customer accounts.

A couple of weeks ago I had written that I identified BofA as removing vast quantities of gold, 25.9 tonne, from registered at JP Morgan's vault.  This could be BofA's silver.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another\_75\_tonne\_of\_gold\_moved\_out\_of\_jp\_morgans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another_75_tonne_of_gold_moved_out_of_jp_morgans/)

&#x200B;

JP Morgan's eligible metal stands at 133.3 million oz. From that, deduct the 103 million oz that is ""owned"" by SLV's authorized participants (and probably a few other parties) which leaves 30.3 million oz. Again, that would be the total of customer and the bank's silver.

I had documented the occasions where it became apparent that the JP Morgan, the bank, was out of silver during 2022 although they have likely restocked to some extent. I always pay special attention to JP Morgan as they are the cabal's lead banker.

Today's comex total of 27.3 million oz is a 6.5 year low last seen in December 29, 2016.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  June silver contracts

Another day with no delivery notices on the June silver contract where 2.16 million oz awaits delivery. Same on the micro silver contract where another 324 koz await delivery. On the micro silver contract, the naked short is CME. Yes those are the folks that run the comex exchange. 

As the tide runs out we're going to learn who else is shorting naked:

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  July silver contracts

Yesterday I mentioned there was a surge in ""privately negotiated trades"" on the upcoming July silver contract which arrested the two week surge in open interest.  The heightened PNT trades continued with 3,361 contracts. Despite that the total OI had a modest gain of 1,266 contracts:

It is interesting to note that the July contract OI at day 9 is 12.5 times the registered vault total, and that is the highest in the post covid era. But you should skip this plot too:

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold Vaults

There was a large move out of the gold vaults at JP Morgan's vaults, 221 koz or 6.86 tonne. That's 2.5% of JP Morgan's vault total and 1% of comex total.

A couple of weeks ago I documented huge moves at JP Morgan's gold vault as metal  moved out of registered. Now it appears that it is going out of the vault.

On May 23 and 24 there were 589 koz or 18.3 tonne moved out of registered. I posted an analysis that showed that the likely perp was almost certainly BofA. They are the only party that has net stopped that much gold, specifically 30.5 tonne since March 30 of this year and 124 tonne over the last 2-1/2 years.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147\_tonne\_vacates\_jp\_morgans\_comex\_gold\_vault/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147_tonne_vacates_jp_morgans_comex_gold_vault/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13rrxjy/the\_2\_day\_departure\_of\_gold\_out\_of\_jp\_morgans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13rrxjy/the_2_day_departure_of_gold_out_of_jp_morgans/)

Since those moves out of registered, JP Morgan's gold vault has been fairly quiet. It isn't a certainty that this is BofA's gold that was 1) recently bought at comex and 2) moved out of registered and 3) now moved out of the vault. But it is likely. 

If it is BofA's gold, this 6.86 tonne would represent 38% of the that 18.3 tonne moved out of registered on May 23 and 23. We may get some clarity in the days ahead if there is a follow up move(s) out of the vault.

Why care? BofA has been a huge buyer of gold at comex over the last 2-1/2 years. They have bought a net 4.0 million oz (124 tonne). IF (notice that is in uppercase), all of that was in JP Morgan's vault, that would represent 80% of the JP Morgan vault total. Yesterday's move of 6.86 tonne is only 6% of BofA's net stopped gold. How's that for an avalanche waiting to fall?

The numbers to the oz:

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Silver Vaults

A truckload (640 koz) was deposited at Loomis' vault and a half truckload departed Brinks for a net increase of 361 koz:

No change in registered, and even with 6 continuous days of no change in registered. That is no big deal.

I hear that yesterday one of my (blocked) trolls on Twitter is making a deal about there being 5 days of no change in registered silver. BFD. In fact, it is the 4th time **this year** that has occurred.  Even after yesterday's 6th day in a row of no change, a continuous 6 day span has happened **3 times this year**.

It's still about 10 days too early to look at the countdown to first notice on the July silver contract, however I can't help but notice that the OI decline is less than average:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atgitobcd16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e3d70dae95e6edc754db1b3bb6e117997dcade

This next plot is the daily change in OI ... essentially the derivative of the plot above. Note that the daily decline is running a couple of thousand contracts per day below average.

https://preview.redd.it/9cxkl8tdd16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=f30b6ba11498d193f4569daba0f8ba705a96491e

Meanwhile traders are flooding into the September contract causing a surge in total OI. See the plot below.

Note the blue line for the May 23 contract also experienced an OI surge at this point in the cycle. I'll have to think about why they are mirroring each other.

https://preview.redd.it/8fxlgoi1g16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45b37db55b061074291ccbba31deea21f3235e4

Yesterday the OI increase for the September contract (7,296) was more than double the decline for July (3,167). Usually, during the core of the roll, these are offsetting. The total OI increase is 4,382.

https://preview.redd.it/0irkrj49e16b1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd75b58dc3188094aec25ff0b3caafb8b09e54d6

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    comex vaults

Yesterday was ""take it away Tuesday"" at the comex vaults. One truckload (600 koz) departed JP Morgan and Loomis' vaults, 476 koz was out of Delaware Depository and 100 koz was out of CNT. All of that was somewhat offset by a 487 koz deposit at JP Morgan and 300 koz at Brinks.

The net change was 978 koz OUT OF THE VAULT:

https://preview.redd.it/ht16uy1nh16b1.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=a01f6d1361ea8579346c19f2e7841b9f18279476

&#x200B;

But that was nothing compared to gold.  Brinks' gold vault saw a 162 koz or 5.0 tonne departure. That is 3.4% of Brinks' vault total.

Scrolling back in time, Brinks had a 367 koz move out of registered on May 30, just a couple of weeks ago. That date was first notice day on the June contract so I have to try to pair that move with a gold buyer. However, nobody stopped that much gold, so I can't point the finger at anyone specifically. The largest buyer(s) that day were JP Morgan customer accounts at 353 koz ... fairly close. It is possible the vault move was JP Morgan customer account gold.

Here was the detail from that day:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely\_odd\_day\_for\_comex\_silver\_all\_just\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely_odd_day_for_comex_silver_all_just_to/)

Here we are 10 biz days later and 162 koz moves out of the vault. It's logical to connect those, although that is not certain. Perhaps that 5 tonne will show up at JP Morgan's vault or perhaps another large comex player is buying gold at comex, moving it out of registered and then OUT OF THE VAULT.

Asahi, the new vault, showed a 48 koz deposit.

According to the list of global systemically important banks ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_systemically_important_banks), [Financial Stability Board (FSB)](https://www.fsb.org/2022/11/2022-list-of-global-systemically-important-banks-g-sibs/), [FSB PDF](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P211122.pdf)), JP Morgan Chase is top dog as the *only Tier 4* bank.  (The higher the tier, the more systemic risk the bank poses to the financial system so the required capital buffer is higher at each tier.)

>A systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis). They are colloquially referred to as ""[**too big to fail**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail)"". \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution)\]

According to the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements), which has a [dashboard](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/) showing scores and components for Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs), JP Morgan Chase is by itself in Tier 4 with the highest overall risk rating as the most interconnected bank with the most complex banking relationships.

***If*** **JP Morgan Chase were to fail, the financial system would be at high risk of a financial crisis.**  *Which means JPM Chase is in an interesting position because the global financial system is both incentivized to keep JPM from failing and, if an institution is to fail, putting the most complex and interconnected financial institution at risk* ***maximizes the likelihood of another bailout***.

Some of you may remember from 2 years ago (April 15, 2021) that JP Morgan sold $13B in bonds in the largest bank deal ever at the time ([SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt6bju/why_banks_randomly_decided_to_sell_billions_in/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/jpmorgan-to-sell-13-billion-of-bonds-in-largest-bank-sale-ever)) to raise money.  The next day, Bank of America takes the lead by selling $15B worth of bonds ([SuperStonk DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsioql/the_complete_bank_of_america_gamestop_dd/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/bofa-to-set-record-for-largest-bank-bond-sale-at-15-billion#xj4y7vzkg), April 16, 2021).

So if JP Morgan needed to raise some serious money *without getting a bailout*, buying another bank in a sweetheart deal seems like another way to juice up JP Morgan's balance sheet with some good PR. According to [CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/01/business/first-republic-purchase-hnk-intl/index.html),

>First Republic ... had assets of **$229.1 billion** as of April 13. As of the end of last year, it was the nation’s **14th-largest bank**, according to a ranking by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States with total global assets of **nearly $4 trillion** as of March 31.

Now that JP Morgan picked up First Republic, their total assets increases by about $229B (about 5.7%).  And, according to Reuters \[[Factbox](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-deal-collapsed-first-republic-explained-2023-05-01/)\], JP Morgan just got a pretty sweet deal with First Republic Bank:

* JPMorgan Chase will pay **$10.6 billion** to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC)
* Will **not** assume First Republic's corporate **debt** or preferred stock
* FDIC to provide [loss share agreements](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/) with respect to most acquired loans

So JP Morgan paid $10.6B to pick up $229B (less than 5c on the dollar), passes on the corporate debt, and shares losses with the FDIC so that:

* JPMorgan expects one-time gain of **$2.6 billion** post-tax at closing
* Estimated to add roughly **$500 million to net income** and be accretive to tangible book value per share

**That's a pretty damn good deal.**  Let's look more into what the FDIC says about [shared loss agreements (SLA)](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/jqe3z9ira9xa1.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=cefb80e4cb215985e0ac3c5836fe1c77316b7b7e)

The FDIC absorbs a portion of the loss on assets sold through resolving a failed bank ""sharing the loss with the purchaser of the failed bank"".  *Sounds like the FDIC just took one for the team.*

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/7qob3s6qb9xa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bfd02469344d43cef0f50540691e63c9c08b22a)

According to the FDIC, loss sharing is basically an 80/20 split (except for after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis when the split was 95/5, which has ended).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/alkxtvz6c9xa1.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d900e614b00abc103fb360936f421a708a047e2)

According to the FDIC, resolving a failed bank with loss sharing is supposed to be based on **the least costly option** (to the Deposit Insurance Fund).  (We've seen this least costly option come up in resolving bank failures before with the FDIC and Federal Reserve contemplating requiring Too Big To Fail banks sell destined-to-fail bonds to absorb losses and reduce payouts by the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund \[[SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/zdebh6/comment_against_the_federal_reserve_fdic_proposal/)\])

According to [Investopedia, JPMorgan To Pay FDIC $10.6 Billion For First Republic, This is What It Gets](https://www.investopedia.com/what-does-jpmorgan-get-in-first-republic-deal-7487296), resolving FRC bank failure will cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $13B.

>The FDIC will take a **$13 billion hit to its fund** and *provide $50 billion in financing*.

Wait, the **FDIC is providing $50B to finance JPM buying FRC?!**

https://preview.redd.it/4j4du9umk9xa1.png?width=3492&format=png&auto=webp&s=33069c143c5351f6b2e616e6c826fc543090e181

The FDIC loaned JP Morgan $50B to buy the failed First Republic bank for $10.6B.  $30B of that was used to repay a [rescue deal from March (last month)](https://www.investopedia.com/first-republic-s-usd30b-rescue-by-jp-morgan-citi-and-bank-of-america-7367932) backed by JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.  Which means JP Morgan gets their money back from the previous rescue *plus* an **extra $9.4B** out of this loan deal to buy $229B worth of assets from First Republic.

On top of that, JP Morgan splits losses with the FDIC 80/20 with the FDIC covering 80% of loan losses for the next 5-7 years (5 years for commercial loans and 7 years for residential mortgages).

**Imagine if a bank** ***loans you*** **$9,400 to buy a $229,000 house.**  No down payment.  Just ""here's $9,400 and the keys to that $229,000 house"". Oh, and the bank will cover 80% of the cost for anything that breaks in the house for the next 5-7 years.  *This is an insane deal.*

**Which truly makes one wonder if this is a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout for JP Morgan,** the *only* Tier 4 GSIB as the most interconnected bank with the most complex banking relationships and the highest overall systemic risk rating.

Are we going to see:

1. Fat bonuses at JP Morgan?
2. Followed by news about JP Morgan posing a systemic risk?
3. Followed by calls to bail out JP Morgan to save pensions?

This is exactly why anonymity and privacy is so important in crypto as a future of finance and potential TradFi and banking replacement/improvement, as well as the significance of decentralization","19 States accused JP Morgan on closing accounts on religious or political beliefs. This is exactly why anonymity and privacy is so important in crypto as a future of finance and potential TradFi and banking replacement/improvement, as well as the significance of decentralization 19 states have come out accusing JP Morgan of of closing accounts and discriminating against customers due to their political or religious beliefs. A letter to JP Morgan said ""the bank had canceled major organizations' checking accounts and  had asked screening questions focused on religion and politics before  reinstating them"" JPMorgan also allegedly declined a proposal on participation in a  survey for the Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index, which is meant to determine ""freedom of expression and freedom of religion or  belief as a standard part of doing business,"". JPMorgan had received a score of 15% for the index in 2022 which obviously shows their massive bias and give credibility to the claims.

It's significant enough that JP Morgan would randomly close accounts, and defenders would have said it's due to anti-money laundering politcies/bank secrecy act etc, absolutely ridiculous and makes their intentions clear when they ask questions that screen customers religious and political beliefs before customers have just a *chance* to get their accounts reinstated.

There's been a bit of a push and pull in crypto whereby some people disagree with the need to anonymity. I'd argue that these are privileged people who've had no issues with banks having their information, but they only had no issues because they had money, which the bank wanted. The government view of crypto regulation is definitely to peel back that anonymity as far back as they can. But this situation shows exaclly why anonymity is important, as it immediately solves problems of discrimination as well as safety of the individuals as well so as not to become target, either of societal or corporate discrimination, or criminals.

And crypto balances it very well with allowing *privacy* but not *confidentiality*. Privacy means a lack of direct intrusion into private or personal affairs, so an anonymous blockchain has privacy, but not confidentiality.  This as confidentiality deals more with a complete block of access to information like the government sealing documents and offering no access at all.

It also ties right back into decentralization, where no centralized entity has the power to deny access to services on the blockchain. We all know that power corrupts and JP Morgan has way too much of that. Instead we have a decentralized blockchain where it would take a (mostly) democratic process to deny access to services, and even then it's pretty rare.

JP Morgan,"Gold OI declines 11,345 contracts and has now given back most of the OI surge from 2 weeks ago. Plus JP Morgan adds another truckload for the 5th day in a row.","Gold OI declines 11,345 contracts and has now given back most of the OI surge from 2 weeks ago. Plus JP Morgan adds another truckload for the 5th day in a row. The upcoming inactive June silver contract's open interest continues to drift upwards despite the chaos on the gold contracts. It now stands at 1,120 contracts. Typically nearly all of the OI of these inactive month contracts stand for delivery. First notice day is in 7 days.

https://preview.redd.it/i2jsvm8o9u0b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=416b79e3fb992185b1478ed0ef595be4ed71ffb3

I've rarely mentioned the micro silver contract. The ticker is SIL and it is a 1,000 oz deliverable contract. A guy on twitter, [@EsScalping](https://twitter.com/EsScalping), pointed out that there is also an ""E-mini"" silver contract. That ticker is QI and is for 2,500 oz but is only financially settled. You can't get silver on QI so it'll never impact comex vault totals.

Back to the SIL 1,000 oz micro contract. I mentioned yesterday that what's been happening is the CME group is making a market in the SIL contract.

Essentially there are three fairly big buyers and no sellers. The CME folks buy metal on the 5,000 oz SI contract and sell it to those 3 players on the 1,000 oz SIL contract.

I should probably say, I'm referring to the physical market ... those that stand for delivery. There may be others trading paper contracts, but I can't identify them.  I'm addressing the names I see on the issues and stops report for physical metal.

The CME group has sold 21.44 million oz net since 2019 and those three customer accounts have bought 21.42 million oz. The cumulative net tally for each is as follows:

There's been a few bubbas that have occasionally stopped contracts, but you can see it is round off.

When the CME folks buy metal at the SI contract, it is essentially like some combination of these 3 customer accounts buying it. The metal just passes through, usually the same day.

Below are plots of the issues, stops and net for 1) the CME group, and 2) the largest buyer, Advantage customer accounts. Note that Advantage has rarely sold any silver.

I've considered adding the two contracts (SI and SIL) together for my graphics. The only reason I haven't is that the reader will have a difficult time tracking the raw numbers from the report to the graphs. Personally, I like to do that when viewing plots to gain confidence in the data. For now, I haven't added them. Currently, some of the larger issues and stops from the SIL contract are greater than the smaller, inactive months, on the SI contract. So I may start adding them for plots in the future.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold

The gold open interest fell another 11,345 contracts and has now given back much of the OI surge that occurred 2 weeks ago:

The June active month is 7 days to first notice and has now fallen below the average:

Over lunch today I listened to a podcast that mentioned an increase in gold EFP (exchange for physical) volume. EFP's are a swap of a comex futures contract with a ""physical"" contract in London. Settlement by EFP rarely induces metal leaving London vaults.

As far as an EFP surge, I'm not seeing it. I track the cumulative EFP volume after zeroing the meter at day 44 (the start of the OI plateau). See the plot below. The June gold contract was riding the average line (the bold black line ) until recently and then drifted slightly below trend.

That said, the number of contracts that routinely vacate comex by EFP is huge. Usually it exceeds the total gold in registered as you can see below. The current registered gold is shown as the horizontal green line.

Yesterday I forgot to mention that the new vault operated by Asahi Depository, showed 1.2 million oz moved to registered and that is added to the comex vault registered total.

The day prior's statement for Asahi had all zeros. It was odd that their account statement didn't show metal being present the day before or being ""received"" on yesterday's report.  It just showed the ""adjustment"", which is the move to registered. Typically a move to registered has a deduct from eligible. Essentially, it just magically arrived.

Magic accounting. I wonder what's actually in Asahi's vault?

JP Morgan,📰 History Repeating – Jp Morgan & Rothschilds Redux,"📰 History Repeating – Jp Morgan & Rothschilds Redux **HISTORY REPEATING – JP MORGAN & ROTHSCHILDS REDUX** 

Little bit of a history of the gold/silver standard and what amounted to the Panic of 1896.  What’s interesting in this history lesson are the players and what they were trying to achieve – Rothschild and JP Morgan.  130 years later the same lessons are being told but the main players have not changed and the ultimate gain is banking as opposed to railway. 

JP Morgans undocumented manipulation of the gold and silver market has long been a speculated rumour and somewhat difficult thing to prove. So today we thought we’d take you on a journey back to 1895 – where speculation and government collusion were in fact tools used by JP Morgan and Rothschilds to both save the US from economic collapse and line their own pockets.  The result was the strengthening of these financial institutions, which over the years have used the same playbook to further enhance their market dominance and back-handed deals rewarding and not punishing their financial prowess.

The playbook? Wait for the government to fall into a panic or a financial crisis. Save the day. Manipulate markets to your advantage, and walk away with monopolistic powers.  In 1914 JP Morgan emerged as the major player and owner of railways in the US.  2023 JP Morgan emerges as the major player in US banking.  Both a mechanism of trade control – 1914 Industrial revolution trade control and 2023 banking and finance trade control.

**What’s a Panic?**

Rather than googling financial crisis – google panic, Pre-1900 the panic terminology appears to apply to any bubble or distorted market leading to market manipulation and panic, otherwise now known as a financial crisis.  Some examples include:

**Panic of 1819**

This was the first US widespread panic, driven by the end of the Napoleonic wars, it was compounded by asset bubbles in speculation in public lands – fueled by the unrestrained issue of ‘paper money’

**Panic of 1837**

Another panic set off from a real estate bubble and erratic American banking policy. Deflation set in with profit, prices and wages dropping.

**Panic of 1873**

This panic started in Europe with a stock market crash leading to investors liquidating bonds, in particular railway bonds in the US due to overdevelopment and speculation in railway.

**The Panic of 1893 and 1896**

Triggered by factors such as a failed coup in Argentina, a run on gold in the U.S. Treasury, and an oversupply of silver.

You see the gist here – gets a little 1800 repetitive and it was no wonder property prices remained fairly subdued throughout the 19th Century. It appears in the 20th Century, those Panic lessons may have been well and truly forgotten and the same old real estate lax banking bubbles emerged.

But for this history lesson we will focus on 1873 and 1893, and the great fortune JP Morgan was able to accumulate during this time and the role of gold and bonds that saw JP Morgan emerge as the US’s most powerful financial and railroad tycoon.

**Railroad Playbook**

JP Morgan cofounded Drexel, Morgan and company in 1871, becoming JP Morgan and company in 1895.  What seemed like a bad time to be in business turned out to be fortuitous to JP Morgan.  The Panic of 1873 started with the rampant inflation driven from overspeculation in railroads and the demonetization of silver in Germany and the US.  Following the American Civil War, 33,000 miles of railroad were built between 1868 and 1873.  Within the railroad craze a large infusion of cash was raised via bonds.  In 1871 Germany demonetized silver leading to an oversupply of silver, particularly in the US who mined most of the supply.  In 1873 the US passed the Coinage Act of 1873 backing the US dollar to a de facto gold standard.   This immediately depressed silver prices further, reduced money supply and raised interest rates hurting farmers.  People then shied away from long term bonds and collapsed the railway bond market.

In 1873 the precipice of the Panic happened when Jay Cooke and Company couldn’t sell millions of dollars of Northern Pacific Railway Bonds leading to its bankruptcy. By 1874 60 railroads had gone bankrupt 

In 1875 Congress backed the USD with gold helping to curb and stabilize the dollar.

It was 10 years after the collapse in railway bonds that JP Morgan emerged as a railway force, this time reorganizing railways, merging them and taking stakes, such as in 1885 when he arranged a merger between New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad.  

**Morgan-Belmont Syndicate**

Following the 1893 Panic, paper money was being exchanged for gold from treasury, draining the US Treasury of gold.  The hot money movement as it was later known had all the hallmarks of a self compelling bank run on Treasury due to a distrust of the US government’s gold reserve.  There was a rapid decline in gold reserves from $121,0000,000 on January 1st 1893 to $66,000,000 on February 1st 1894.  Under these circumstances the government used 4 subscriptions of $50,000,000 of 5% 10 year bonds over a 1894-1895.  But each time treasury again saw gold continue to pour out of treasury.  Speculative international transactions prompted by the fear of the ceasing of the gold standard saw another net outflow of $84,000,000 between October 1894 and January 1895, investors were liquidating bank balances and railroad bonds for gold and sending this gold to Europe at an increasing rate.

To assist with the US predicament a famous meeting between President Cleveland and JP Morgan in 1895 produced a syndicate and its contract on February 8th 1895.  The contract failed to name syndicate members with a veil of secrecy, although it is now known the syndicate included both Rothschilds and JP Morgan to name some of the more notable firms.  The contract was for the syndicate to bolster gold stock and stop outflows. The syndicate agreed to purchase 3,500,000 ounces of gold and sell it to the government with 4% 30 year bonds.  

The syndicate acquired $62,315,400 in government bonds at a 4% return, which they sold at 3 ¾% almost immediately for $68,833,591 – a tidy $5,000,000 immediate profit. Additional to the gold they delivered, within a week the syndicate saw other gold inflows of $10,000,000 from domestic holders.

The second condition was the syndicate exert control on the market (manipulate) to stop gold outflows.  The syndicate contract lasted 6 months, with the Syndicate manipulating control over the exchange rate to ensure enhanced profits from the arrangements

*‘The unique and imprecise manner by which authority was delegated by the government to a private syndicate to control the foreign-exchange market would be unthinkable in modern time’*

During this time it was also identified that the syndicate used moral suasion (more manipulation) to ensure other gold holders/investors did not withdraw further gold.  They appealed to these investors by giving bonds at preferential terms they would adhere to the ‘ship no gold’ agreement. Articles at the time supported the Syndicate and the moral suasion such as the United States Investor revered the Syndicate for stopping the previous deflation 

‘*To those persons to criticize the bond syndicate for keeping the price of the exchange at such high figures, it is sufficient to say that had the Syndicate not intervened, the cost of paying debts cold be even greater than at present, because gold would be in transit instead of exchange.’*

The Syndicate succeeded in reinvigorating faith in the US government and dollar and saw a period of prosperity follow, but it seems from this point the US Government owed the architects of the syndicate a favour.   And it appears during this time the Syndicate learnt the economic benefits of precious metal manipulation.

The end of the agreement saw Europe liquidate some of these railway bonds, which we’re sure became the icing on JP Morgans Railway cake as he emerged in 1902 as the largest US railway owner, controlling 5,000 miles of US railroads.

**JP Morgan and First Republic Bank today**

We all know this more recent story of JP Morgans takeover of multiple banks – Bear Sterns, First Republic Bank with the government again leaning on the financial Behemoth to help save the US dollar.  But just like in 1895 the favors and profits to be made are enhancing both the strength and influence of JP Morgan. 

During the First Republic deal laws were broken and profits were made, putting JP Morgan in a stronger monopolistic position in US banking, just like the railways in 1902.

The US law that needed to be circumvented, as JPMorgan ‘*is so big that by* **law it would not be allowed to buy First Republic** *because no one bank can have more than a 10 per cent market’*

And the profit made by JP Morgan: *‘Recognize an upfront, one-time, post-tax gain of approximately $2.6 billion, which does not reflect the approximately $2.0 billion dollars of post-tax restructuring costs anticipated over the next 18 months’*

History Repeats.

**Finally just a little bit of 2023/1873 comparison**

* 1998 tech boom leading to the 2000 collapse- with overinvestment and hype in a new technology – railway vs internet (Panic of 1873)
* 2008 Financial Crisis and deflation (Panic of 1895)
* And finally 2022 inflation, 14 years after the GFC, bought on by Covid, compared  the 1917  during and proceeding World War 1. With inflation in 1920 hitting 25% and 1921 a sharp reversal -15% so will we see a similar pattern in 2024/2025?

JP Morgan,14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect.,"14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect. Excuse me ... change that headline to registered vault. No hyperbole intended. On with the show ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A huge move, 14.7 tonne or 471,000 oz, is out of registered gold on today's vault report ... all of it out of JP Morgan's vault.

Often, but not always, metal moved out of registered ends up being moved out of the vault soon thereafter. Time will tell on that. Regardless, it is a move away from being sold at comex. The size of the move is noteworthy.

Inquiring minds want to know ... who did it? Obviously, it could be any of the comex players who had 14.7 tonne or more in JP Morgan's vault. But that rules out a lot of entities.

I can guess who may be on that short list based on who bought gold recently from JP Morgan or JP Morgan customer accounts. If they stopped metal from those players, the gold would reside in JP Morgan's vault.

Recall that on March 30 of this year JP Morgan issued delivery notices on 10,682 gold contracts. That's 33.2 tonne of gold. I'm talking the house account. The bank. They had shorted gold like f'ing hell during the $150 March rally in an attempt to defend the cabal's fiat. If they hadn't gold would have gone up a lot more than $150.

Here's the procedure to guess who removed the metal: 

Since the metal is in JP Morgan's vault, I looked at all the gold sold by JP Morgan and its customer accounts only. Scrolling back through time, those entities sold 320,000 oz or 3.82 tonne from March 31 onward ... not enough to source today's vault departure.

In other words, if this is metal was bought recently, it would have to include part of the 33.2 tonne sold by JP Morgan's house account on March 30. 

That's extremely interesting. That was an epic sale by JP Morgan. It was the largest sale ever for them, and now it may be involved in metal moving out of comex.

Next, I looked at who stopped (bought) that 33.2 tonne JP Morgan sold on March 30. While you typically don't know which short's metal went to which long, in this case JP Morgan accounted for 63% of the gold sold that day, so you can guess that the big buyers that day got a sizable piece of JP Morgan's metal.

Below are the players who stopped more than one tonne that day. The primary suspects from this list are BofA, Citi and Morgan Stanley customer accounts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvybhgpmmv1b1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ce5df2dab1943e86ebd5c9cda8807312bc168b

Next I looked at all the ***net*** metal stopped since March 30 by all comex players. This would be from any and all sellers. See the list below. Note that some of this metal may have been acquired from non-JP Morgan sellers, but it would be near impossible to screen further to who stopped metal from only JP Morgan's vault.

https://preview.redd.it/exdzw80fnv1b1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=56832df2c8b05b5875e7984557805b7f5a5634d2

Note that Citi isn't on the list as they sold all of the metal bought on March 30 (plus another 5%). So Citi is off the suspect list and the list is down to 2.

Morgan Stanley customers acquired 8.1 tonne on March 30 and another 1.8 tonne after March 30. Their accrued net purchase since March 30 is 9.9 tonne. It IS possible that they moved their newly bought 9.9 tonne plus another 4.8 tonne they had bought previously, but this is less likely. Furthermore, this all assumes that Morgan Stanley customers are all acting together, or are (mostly) one entity.  I think they are a long shot.

That leaves BofA. What about them?

BofA stopped 13.6 tonne on March 30 and another 16.9 tonne since for a total of 30.5 tonne. Furthermore, they haven't sold **any** gold at all over the last 4 months which is an indication of the direction of their intent ... not flipping metal. The accumulated gold bought since March 30 far surpasses today's vault move of 14.7 tonne. They are the lead suspect.

Who'dve thunk. It wasn't Putin or Xi after all.

The possibility that one of comex's biggest gold players is buying metal and removing it from (at least) registered, is significant. BofA has bought a net 125 tonne since becoming active in early 2021. If this 14.7 tonne is their metal, that would be 12% of their stack.  And maybe more is going out!

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Silver Vaults

JP Morgan did NOT move a truckload into the vaults today, unlike the prior 7 days. Perhaps their silver stack rebuild is complete at 4.2 million oz. If so, that is nothing like the volumes they could effortlessly deliver with the click of the mouse, like 30 million oz at a time. That was before they were downgraded to jay pee pee.

A net 340,000 oz is out of the vault and 400,000 oz was moved out of registered at JP Morgan's vault. BofA?

That's 18% of registered ... over twice the typical. Plus, JP Morgan's 7 day vault re-stack binge is now up to 4.2 million oz of silver. 5 days to first notice. The June inactive month silver contract is counting down to first notice day with 5 (biz) days to go. The OI has stabilized at 1,133 contracts or about 5.5 million oz. Just noticing that the SIL contract (the 1,000 oz micro) has about 1.2 million oz ready to stand for delivery too.

Back to just the SI contract ... while that OI plots as near the average of prior contracts (shown below on the countdown plot), it is much greater than recent months.

Plus, as a fraction of registered silver, it's one of the highest months over the last 3 years. At the current OI, it accounts for 18.5% of registered whereas the average inactive month (at day 5) is 7.3%:

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold

Gold contracts continue to close with the total OI declining 6,192 contracts. Based on recent price activity, you'd assume this is being driven by longs closing contracts.

https://preview.redd.it/i91alig6wm1b1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=31297c4b924435057c017bd92e2bd80531dcacae

The June contract is now rolling to August, so I track the OI with the sum of the two:

Based on the June countdown plot, it would appear that of the roll pair contracts (June and August) most of the reduction is in the August contract. I say that because the June contract is 16,000 below the mean, whereas the sum of the two is 39,000 below the mean. The June contract OI is as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/jdk80qrswm1b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=40e5fdb3603b296e3f830848ef2a8677fb016523

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver Vaults

For the 7th day in a row a truckload was received at JP Morgan's vault. If you've not yet been enlightened, a truckload in my jargon is 600,000 oz. A lot of comex silver moves in lots of 600k. That is also a typical payload that can be moved by most class 8 trucks in the USA. Converted to lbs that is 41,000. And for you people that haven't yet converted, that is 18,800 kilos.

So that is now 4.2 million oz of newly arrived metal at JP Morgan's vault over the last 7 days. This is not unlike JP Morgan's restocking of 30 tonne of gold with 6 deposits between March 31 and May 2.

Today, however, the 600k oz deposit at JP Morgan was offset by a 1.1 million oz move out of the vault. Furthermore, 35,000 oz was transferred out of registered at JP Morgan's vault.

For the totals of all 10 comex vaults,  600k was moved in, 2.5 million oz was moved out for a net decline of 1.9 million oz. Also 280,000 oz was moved out of registered to eligible.

JP Morgan,Another 7.5 tonne of gold moved out of JP Morgan's registered vault brings the 3 day total to 25.9 tonne and zeros out the entirety of comex 400 oz registered gold.,"Another 7.5 tonne of gold moved out of JP Morgan's registered vault brings the 3 day total to 25.9 tonne and zeros out the entirety of comex 400 oz registered gold. The comex gold contracts had another large reduction in open interest dropping by 10,886 contracts. Give it a yawn. That is typical for this point in the cycle (2 days to first notice).  Basically, there are a lot of folks who hang around with about 5 or 6 days to go who are not hedgers. They are arbs or folks trying to pick up some fiat as the herd rolls or closes. They just close without rolling.

The raw numbers:

That 10,886 decline drops the OI well below the pre-OI surge level from about 3 weeks ago:

https://preview.redd.it/xjbmrdinq92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6adea51f149847d74ad0d99d96b7581023a865f

Currently we are in the last days of the roll period from the June contract to the August contract. See the OI countdown plot below. The number of contracts that closed on the June contract was 42,498 which is exactly the average.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8xkqppht92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=aced6c293570491b5b3faa1f8cb908fc879e22ac

What happened, and almost always happens at this point, is that many of those contracts didn't roll to August. They just closed. The new August contracts totaled 31,219 or 11,279 less. However, this 11,279 is routine for day 2. In fact usually it is even greater at 14,500.

&#x200B;

The June contract OI is now 58% of registered metal in the vault:

https://preview.redd.it/wr5tgow8t92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e979180681727b76d38dc43ce874581637c24fb

Moving on the the gold vaults ...  the story at JP Morgan's vault is more bizarre. There was an additional 242,611 oz (or 7.5 tonne) moved out of JP Morgan's vault. This time the move was from the 400 oz vault.

You may recall the March 2020 near crack up at comex. In an effort to add physical supply, comex changed its rules such that contracts could be settled with 400 oz bars in addition the the usual 100 oz bars. An additional category was added to the vault report specifically for the 400 oz bars.

Considering all of comex (not just JP Morgan), as of yesterday's report only 242,611 oz or 2% of comex registered gold consisted of 400 oz bars. That gives some indication of how many settlements consist of 400 oz bars. Eligible gold consisted of 3,895,686 oz (or 35%) in 400 oz bars.

Therefore, this 242,611 oz move from registered to eligible zeros out comex registered in the 400 oz bar category.

&#x200B;

Was that 242,611 oz move on today's report also BofA?   Over the two prior days BofA (at least it is a high probability it was BofA) moved 18.3 tonne out of JP Morgan's registered (in the 100 oz vault). I'd bet that it was BofA which would bring their 3 day move out of registered to 25.9 tonne.

Moving on to other vault changes ... there was also a 250,778 oz (7.8 tonne) move *into* registered at JP Morgan's vault.

Since that is all getting complicated, I'll cut and paste the raw report for the JP Morgan portion of the vault report:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3uuerj4ix92b1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=e88e1bc33b92e57df360b739a6ace2fb47080dbb

I doubt that BofA is moving metal out of, and then back into, registered. So I don't think this is connected to the discussion above. I suspect that we will see someone issue 2,510 contracts early next week.  I'll wait until then to see who's name is printed on the issues and stops report. I have a premonition who that may be.

&#x200B;

Other vault moves ... one tonne into MTB's vault. And the net of all that is ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver

First notice day on the June inactive silver contract is also Monday. FYI ... FND of gold and silver contracts are always synced. The June silver open interest continues flat at 1,114 contracts or 5.57 million oz. Another 1.34 million oz is about to stand for delivery on the micro contract for a total of 6.91 million oz. That'll require 23% of the registered silver.

Speaking of the vault, registered dropped below 30 million oz again. 600 k is out of registered at MTB and 300 k out at HSBC.

The new vault, Asahi, showed 600 k oz arriving with a small offset of 55 k oz departing. The net of all that is ...

JP Morgan,"The 2 day departure of gold out of JP Morgan's registered vault jumps to 18.3 tonne, a 16% haircut.","The 2 day departure of gold out of JP Morgan's registered vault jumps to 18.3 tonne, a 16% haircut. Another big day at the gold vaults. There was followup from yesterday's huge move with an additional 118,000 oz or 3.7 tonne moving out of registered at JP Morgan's vault. That is on top of yesterday's 471,000 oz or 14.7 tonne bringing the 2 day total to 18.3 tonne. 

So far, none of that metal has left the vault ... according to the vault reports.

In yesterday's piece, I showed analysis that points the finger at BofA for being the responsible party. You gotta read daily as I can't keep a post concise and repeat the relevant history:

These new vault withdrawal numbers are completely consistent with my BofA guess. In fact, strengthens the BofA case because the alternatives had bought much less than BofA recently. Yesterday I mentioned that there is a lot more where that came from ... and there still is.

Separately, there was a 7.0 tonne deposit at Malca Amit's vault. That is a 35% increase. I don't have any recon on who that could be, but I suspect their name will be on the issues and stops report on Monday.

The upcoming June gold contract is an active month and with first notice day on Monday. The OI trajectory has been declining less than usual the last few days as you can see in the plot below.

Usually the number of contracts standing for delivery ranges from 10-20%. Apparently the gold vaults are managed with more cushion than the silver vaults. Why? Probably because a delivery miss on gold would be game over.

The daily change in OI of the front month contract is shown below. It's the derivative of the plot above. Note that today's trading, day 2 before first notice day, usually has the largest decline in OI.

As the June contract appears at the average (bold black line) on the first plot, when adjusted for the reduction in registered gold, the OI is one of the higher contracts. The June contract has 95% of registered gold compared to the average of 75%.

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Silver

The OI on the June silver contract, an inactive month, is holding around 1,120 contracts. Traders generally don't roll on inactive month contracts which is why the OI isn't plunging like the active month gold contract.

The silver vaults saw 532 koz arrive, mostly at HSBC's vault and 1,087 koz depart mostly at Delaware Depository and HSBC's vaults. The net is 555 koz OUT OF THE VAULT. No change in registered.

JP Morgan,Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank,"Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are helping the Ukrainian government set up a reconstruction bank to steer public seed capital into rebuilding projects that can attract hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment.

The Ukraine Development Fund remains in the planning stages and is not expected to fully launch until the end of hostilities with Russia. But investors will have a preview this week at a London conference co-hosted by the British and Ukrainian governments.

“So many of today’s long-term challenges are best addressed through blended finance and this is one. You need these vehicles to mobilise capital at scale,” said BlackRock vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand, who will be discussing the work on Wednesday.

The World Bank estimated in March that Ukraine would need $411bn to rebuild after the war, and recent Russian attacks have driven that figure higher.

The Kyiv government engaged BlackRock’s consulting arm in November to determine how best to attract that kind of capital, and then added JPMorgan in February. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced last month that the country was working with the two financial groups and consultants at McKinsey.

No formal fundraising target has been set but people familiar with the discussions say the fund is seeking to raise low-cost capital from governments, donors and international financial institutions and leverage it to attract between five and 10 times as much private investment.

BlackRock and JPMorgan are donating their services, although the work will give them an early look at possible investments in the country. The assignment also deepens JPMorgan’s relationship with a longstanding client. The bank has helped Ukraine raise more than $25bn in sovereign debt since 2010 and led the country’s $20bn debt restructuring last year.

The financiers consulted with private and public sector investors and found they wanted to help Ukraine but were leery not just about war losses but also the country’s governance, lack of transparency and shallow capital markets.

What Ukraine needed, BlackRock advised, was a development finance bank to find investment opportunities in sectors such as infrastructure, climate and agriculture and make them attractive to pension funds and other long-term investors and lenders. JPMorgan was brought in partly for its debt expertise.

“The fund is being set up to also give public and private sector investors the opportunity to invest into specific projects and sectors,” said Stefan Weiler, JPMorgan’s head of debt capital markets for central Europe, Middle East and Africa. “There will be different sectoral funds that the fund identified as priorities for Ukraine. The aim is maximise capital participation.”

The structure calls for the fund to use the lower-cost public money, known as concessional capital, to make initial investments and absorb the first losses.

The notion is that this initial seed capital would be a de-risking mechanism, and it would create the potential for private sector capital to come in at scale,” said Brandon Hall, co-head of BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory arm. “Ukraine will have its own organisation to source and syndicate these local investment opportunities.”

To overcome investor concerns about governance, the fund is expected to stock its board with representatives of international financial institutions and governments and hire investment professionals to execute its strategy.

“Our view is that if you have a strong governance structure and an internationally credible set of stakeholders who are in the leadership position in this fund, then that will go a long way,” Hall said",0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,https://on.ft.com/443yCpg,06/20/2023,06:27:00,DoYouWant_the_Cheese,21,Other

JP Morgan is almost certainly restocking the silver vault with a third day in a row of a truckload deposit. Plus Degen ""erisorto"" wins the prize. Yesterday I was writing about the roll period where traders close their position on an upcoming active month contract and open a position in the next active month contract. A high fraction of contracts roll forward as such.

Furthermore, near the start of the roll period, there is a large increase in the number of TAS contracts on both the outgoing and incoming contracts. Basically, traders often utilize the trade at settlement (TAS) alternative to close and/or open their positions.

Below is a plot of the TAS volume for each contract. Focus on the pink shaded ""outgoing"" TAS period around day 17 to 8 days to first notice.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e985osbjvf0b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a39de36f63f00125720a7e6396fde1f07c0a327

It's not readily apparent on the above plot, but the TAS surge almost always lasts 5 continuous business days. Furthermore, it never starts on a Wednesday.

The question I asked was ... why doesn't the TAS surge start on Wednesdays?

FYI ... below are the stats on the start of the 5 day surge:

https://preview.redd.it/vzdenod4wf0b1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e04b0042f57f51528efc32e2f2f9e4b1253d7b

Of the 12,500 degenerates who read yesterday's post, only 1 person figured that out.

Aaaand the winner is ""erisorto"" of the SilverDegenClub:

https://preview.redd.it/ff9an4ydwf0b1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=427333350efa3556ba4ff6f365e2ae08816323f1

To add some commentary to erisorto's comments ...  a couple of months back, the sum total of the 5 day TAS surge was a lot less than usual. I thought I could then look at the CoT and see which category of trader had declined by comparing two subsequent CoT reports. If there was some correlation, that could infer which type of trader exploits TAS during those 5 days.

I then realized that that particular 5 day TAS period spanned 2 CoT reports. That fuzzes up the numbers because you then have to look at three subsequent reports to determine the changes.  It fuzzed things up enough that it wasn't apparent which category was involved.

I looked back through time and ALL of the TAS surge numbers spanned 2 reports. What a coincidink!

FYI ... the CoT report is based on traders position at the end of trading on Tuesday (and posted on Friday). The only way to get a clean week to week change between just 2 reports would be if the TAS surge started on a Wednesday. And that's why it never starts on Wednesday!

Everyone will want to start pointing fingers at the CME folks. However, note that the exchange has no rules or guidance about when to roll, or whether to use TAS or not. It's the traders themselves who decide. Apparently, the vast majority of traders decide to not roll their own position on Wednesdays. Furthermore, they mostly avoid Tuesday and Thursday because that splits the change at a 4:1 ratio (or 1:4). By rolling on Monday or Friday, the change is split by a 3:2 (or 2:3) for maximum obfuscation and that is what they do 75% of the time.

The traders are obfuscating data about themselves. The core driver of this is the weekly schedule of the CoT report with positions reported from the Tuesday close. It would be interesting to see if the CFTC required traders to report, say, twice a week. Would the traders modify their 5 day TAS surge?

Congrats to erisorto.  Comex traders have been parading him around the comex pits all day. He's got an interview on CNBC set for tomorrow morning at the opening bell, plus a visit to the White House later in the week.

And on with the new stuff:

Yesterday I wrote about the gold open interest surging ahead by 14,416 contracts on Monday and how that invited a (price) beat down. Although, when I wrote that, the beat down was in progress (on Tuesday). What I didn't know was the beat down reversed that entire OI increase, dropping OI by 14,189 contracts.

One of the larger OI increases immediately followed by one of the larger reductions:

What happened with silver? The Tuesday smack down did drive a few longs out of the May silver contract ... just 22 contracts. But a near offsetting number (18) opened June contracts as you can see below. This may seem like small potatoes but between the tail of the May contract and the upcoming June contract,  7-1/2 million oz will need delivered shortly. The June contract is an inactive month and typically all of those dudes hang around for delivery.

The shorts on the May contract continue to not deliver metal ... zero delivery notices last night. Eight days left to deliver.

# The firm’s market access controls failed to prevent five erroneous orders routed to exchanges and alternative trading systems:

* On January 30, 2019, a firm trader on the Program Trading Agency Desk routed to the market an order to purchase 50,000 shares of an equity security. 
   * The trader intended to enter a limit price of $268.50, but mistakenly input $286.50. 
   * The firm received executions with prices over 5% higher than the last execution in the market prior to entry of this order. 
   * The firm submitted clearly erroneous filings and approximately half of the 50,000-share order (executions above $276.57) were busted. 
* On July 26, 2019, a client entered a market order to sell 86,500 equity shares instead of the intended limit order. 
   * A trader accepted the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The last share price at the time of order entry was $27.23. 
   * The firm received executions at prices down to $22.25, representing an approximately 18% drop. 
* On December 19, 2019, instead of entering a limit-on-close order, a firm trader on the Equity Finance Trading Desk erroneously entered a limit order to buy 230,000 shares of an equity security at $154.17. 
   * The firm routed the order to the market and received executions with prices up to $154.17, which was approximately 3% higher than the prior execution price at order entry of $149.52. 
   * The firm filed a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $154.01 were busted. 
* On March 26, 2020, a client entered a pairs order in the firm’s system. 
   * While a firm algorithm was handling the order, a control paused the order for manual review. 
   * After the review and the resumption of the order, the algorithm handling the order did not refresh the market data to account for the pause. 
   * In less than one minute, the system routed to various execution venues over 80,000 immediate-or-cancel orders, which the execution venues canceled back unfilled because they were priced away from the prevailing market. 
* On April 22, 2021, a client entered a market order to buy 4,765 equity shares but intended to buy 50 shares at a limit price of $4,765. 
   * The Electronic Client Solutions Desk received the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The firm received executions with prices up to $5,077.30, which was approximately 6% higher than the last traded price of $4,799.99. 
   * The firm submitted a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $4,903.50 were busted. 

# The firm’s erroneous order and duplicative order controls were not reasonably designed:  

* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied fixed single order quantity limits ranging from 100,000 to 9,999,999 shares depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client involved in each order. 
   * The firm also applied static single order notional value limits ranging from $25,000,000 to $500,000,000 depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client. Each of these single order quantity and single order notional value limits applied static limits regardless of security and thus failed to consider the individual characteristics of the security. 
   * The firm further applied average daily volume limits ranging from 25 to 50 percent based on the specific desk, trader, and/or client.
   *  With the exception of one desk’s single order quantity control, the firm’s single order quantity, single order notional value, and average daily value thresholds were too large to be effective, and the firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set them at such levels.
* Moreover, many of the above referenced size controls triggered “soft blocks” when applicable thresholds were reached. 
   * In contrast to a “hard block,” which generally prevents an order from being submitted by automatically rejecting it, a soft block pauses an order until the block is overridden or the order is cancelled back or modified. 
      * For most of the relevant period, however, the firm’s written supervisory procedures did not address how to handle, document, and review soft block overrides. 
      * Accordingly, the firm’s controls that relied on soft blocks did not prevent the entry of certain erroneous orders. 
      * By January 2021, the firm implemented changes to its supervisory requirements relating to soft blocks that included tracking and reviews of soft block overrides and adding compliance trainings and updates to its written supervisory procedures on the handling of soft blocks.
* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied single order limit price controls based on fixed percentages away from the National Best Bid and Offer, ranging from three to 15 percent depending on the desk, trader, and/or client involved. 
   * Like the firm’s size controls, certain limit price thresholds were set too high to be effective. 
   * In particular, the limit price controls generally exceeded the numerical guidelines for clearly erroneous transactions. 
   * The firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set its limit price thresholds at levels greater than the definition of a clearly erroneous transaction. 
      * Additionally, for the same reasons previously noted above, the firm’s supervisory system for soft blocks was deficient for most of the relevant period. 
      * In October 2020, the firm began introducing a price control that applied different thresholds to differently priced securities.  
* Furthermore, the firm did not have a reasonable duplicative order control. 
   * The firm did apply a risk control that checked orders with the same symbol, side, and quantity. 
   * This control triggered a hard block if more than 50,000 order messages with the same symbol, side, and quantity were sent within two seconds. 
   * However, the 50,000-order threshold, which was applied separately to each of the firm’s connections to external venues, was too high to be effective. 
   * The firm provided no documented rationale supporting why such a high threshold was reasonable. 

As of July 2022, the firm had implemented additional controls to prevent the entry of orders that—based on price and/or size of the order relative to the market—could potentially lead to unintended market impact.

# TLDRS:

* From January 2019 to July 2022, the firm’s financial risk management controls and supervisory procedures were not reasonably designed to prevent certain erroneous orders that exceeded appropriate price or size parameters.

>Yet, in addition to close associates of Wexner, Dimon’s coronation as one of the most powerful bankers in the country was also made possible thanks to another powerful clan that also shares close connections to Wexner – the Crown family of Chicago. Perhaps even more than Wexner, the Crowns are a testament to how the worlds of organized crime and corporate power have mixed over the years to produce elites who are truly untouchable. With a long-standing dominant role in the American military-industrial complex as well as other facets of the corporate world, the Crowns have a history of doing what’s necessary – whether legal or illegal – to get what they want to advance their political agendas and grow their own power. Even presidents and the Pentagon have been unable to successfully challenge them. As this article will show, the Crowns – perhaps more than any other group – are a critical part of the story of how Jame Dimon became the king of Wall Street.

That's the ""smart"" money!","The upcoming June silver contract OI, an inactive month, is at 18% of registered silver. Plus, JP Morgan has now nearly restocked its gold vault after dumping 33.5 tonne of gold $200 ago. That's the ""smart"" money! After a huge 3 day surge followed by a one day drop, the total gold contract open interest has settled into normalcy. The June contract is now a few days into the roll period as that contract's OI is falling and the roll month of August is increasing.

Typically there is a total OI increase during this portion of the roll, so today's total OI increase of 3,166 is normal compared to the average of 3,570. You can see the OI cycle below where the solid black line is the arithmetic average:

Isolating the June and August contracts shows the same impact:

Meanwhile back at the May contract which is currently in the delivery period, 218 net new gold contracts were written on Tuesday.  There's still plenty of time left, so call your broker and buy a few gold bars for near immediate delivery.

The issues and stops report shows mostly JP Morgan customers selling gold to other JP Morgan customers. The big players that were very active earlier in the month, BofA and Citi, have ceased activity for now.

&#x200B;

Let's talk silver!

The upcoming June contract's OI has increased to 981, or about 4.9 million oz, and is much higher than recent months. This is an inactive month and typically, these contracts stay open and take delivery. You can see that in the flat bold black average line which stays mostly flat during the run up to first notice day. That's in sharp contrast to the active months where OI is plunging toward FND. Real men buy inactive months ... apparently.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yenuix4h72za1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2af0c7b0eb96f44fea26ccb8a51311862c17bd9f

That 4.9 million oz is 18% of registered vault totals. If you think of it relative to the registered vault total, suddenly the June contract OI is almost twice the average inactive month. See the plot below.

Perhaps that's why some silver is arriving at the vaults lately.

Speaking of the silver vaults, after increasing for each of the last 3 days, 220,000 oz departed the vaults:

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Gold Vaults

The gold vaults saw 55,000 oz arrive at JP Morgan's vault. There have been six 160,000 oz deposits over the last 28 business days. Perhaps today's report is the final installment of JP Morgan's gold rebuild as this brings the recent total deposited to 31.7 tonnes. Recall that they sold 33.5 tonnes on the April contract as they apparently defended the cabal's fiat during the March gold rally.

JP Morgan,"We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan?","We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan? Microstrategy has an insane plan. It's wildly complex and super intricate. After much analysis I have concluded the following:

When BTC goes up, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC goes down, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC crabs, MS buys Bitcoin

When Michael Saylor is sued, MS buys Bitcoin

It may be a bit hard to follow but I can dumb in down for you: MS buys Bitcoin.

I even made a joke of it here, and I think we generally view MS as on 'our side' but MS currently owns around 140,000 BTC which is about 0.72% of circulating supply. It's doesn't sound like *that* much but it's pretty close to close to an entire 1%. In fact, it's almost certain that they will own more than 1% of the total supply at the end of all this. And that percentage is deceiving because we don't know how many BTC is permanently burned, but it's likely quite a lot, so the actual percentage they'll own will be even greater. Chainalysis estimates that up to 20% of the Bitcoin already issued may be permanently lost, which means they own more like 0.9% of what's left.

To put their buys into perspective, in just 2 years since March 2021, they managed to purchase 0.25% of circulating supply. Estimates have put the final Bitcoin to be mined in 2140. Of course, most of us won't be alive, but if MS continues at current rates, they'll have another 2.5% of supply in just 10 years. This is a hard estimate as their are many factors to this but it's fair enough I think. Imagine how much they'll earn in 30 years alone, when we would have all grown old(er).

I don't think we'll look at then the way we do now.",0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12fz6jg/we_encourage_and_laugh_with_microstrategy_now_but/,04/09/2023,02:35:43,OneThatNoseOne,324,Other

JP Morgan,JP Morgan Chase earnings report,"JP Morgan Chase earnings report The 2023 Q2 earnings report for JPMorgan Chase has just been released. Overall, the ER is a remarkable demonstration of the durability and power of the top bank. JPM's results, both top and bottom line, exceeded market forecasts. The fact that the bank declared a solid balance sheet during and after a highly tumultuous time for the banking industry is, in my opinion, more significant.   
The last one or two quarters have been described by certain media as the most difficult for banks since the 2008 crisis. JPM was able to keep a healthy standardised CET1 capital ratio of 13.8% even after the First Republic deal. J.P. Morgan was able to negotiate a favourable price because they were the only reliable buyer for FRC. In a back-of-the-envelope analysis of the transaction, Matt Levine of Bloomberg noted how J.P. Morgan receives good upside and regulatory protection while sharing a large portion of the potential losses if the loans default. Although the estimated $500 million in annual net income for the agreement is small in comparison to the $40 billion or so they already generate, it demonstrates that a bank like JPMorgan can take advantage of the crisis.  
The bank currently has $1.4 trillion in cash and short-term securities, which is a lot of liquidity. I have no doubt that JPM will be able to fulfil these new standards and keep its fortress balance sheet, even though there may be some capital changes and liquidity in the near future as the banking industry adapts to new rules.  
Given the current instability in the banking industry, regulatory standards may be modified in various ways. With Basel III's completion, Dimon himself anticipates ""material changes"" to capital and liquidity. He continued by issuing a warning that the market as a whole as well as end customers would probably be affected by these regulatory changes in the real world.

Following up from last week's analysis, the July contract continues adding net new contracts for immediate delivery. Friday saw 32 move contracts tacked on or 160,000 koz. The cumulative after 5 days is 402 contracts or 2.01 million oz or 5.8% of registered silver.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syii3vhe17bb1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd535a20564b936aed1d04018e6614108bf1eb1

At the silver vaults one even truckload was removed from Brinks' vault. That is 3 days in a row where one even truckload was moved out of registered. I'd surmise that this party is whoever bought part of the 12 million oz sold by Standard Chartered (and delivered out of Brinks' vault). Only 3 parties were issued more than 1.8 million oz that day ...

&#x200B;

* JP Morgan customer accounts -    6.070 million oz
* BofA                                                   2.565 million oz
* Morgan Stanley house account - 2.225 million oz.

Time may tell, or at least indicate, who is moving metal out of registered. It all 12 million oz moves out, that'd be 17 more truckloads.  And, for the record, I'm not predicting that.

&#x200B;

I thought it was odd that silver was moving out of registered in 600 koz batches even thought it hasn't (yet) moved out of the vault. I've documented that silver moves in or out of the vault in 600 koz tranches, but moves from registered to eligible or versa vice could be different.

I don't know if vaults segregate registered from eligible. If it was just a digital reassignment, you'd think they could change status of any amount of silver with just a click the mouse. If they actually move the metal, there could be size considerations to change status.

Curiosity got the best of me and I did the stats. Moves in and out of registered ARE more frequent than most other size moves except small moves (-250,000 to +50,000).  See the histogram below.

And those are thousands of oz on the x-axis:

&#x200B;

But if you consider the percentage of total oz moved, the truckload size change jumps out:

https://preview.redd.it/sc55raxna7bb1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd21a233c2f840bda40cd4f36d7bd5a552f571e

It's possible that there are moves into or out of registered in 600 koz lots only because it arrives or departs the vaults in those sizes. I'm saying that because often silver moves in or out of the vault occur before or soon after the change from registered. To get to the bottom of that, I'd have to strip out moves that weren't associated with a move in or out of the vault. Ain't doing that right now. Maybe someday.

At the end of all that ... I don't know why these 3 Brinks' moves have been 3 sequential 600 koz changes and the metal remains in eligible.

MTB also moved 100 koz out of registered:

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold Vaults

JP Morgan's vault sees 5 even tonne (160 koz) moved out of the vault. That is 3.1% of that vaults total silver. Depository Services of Delaware also sees 12 koz depart.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ckuiqiqjd7bb1.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=33c4e5a7b7b87b223605261a187caaf2e4bd6cfe

The JP Morgan withdrawal isn't connected to any recent moves from registered. The last move exceeding 5 tonne from JP Morgan's registered was May 23, or 34 biz days ago.

Perhaps their recent gold vault build will be reversed:

JP Morgan,"JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz.","JP Morgan's registered silver sees a 600,000 oz departure dropping their vault by 6.9%. That drove all of Comex registered silver down 2.8% to a 6-1/2 year low at 27.3 million oz. The total of JP Morgan's vault of registered silver has dwindled from over 40 million oz at the start of the silver squeeze to 8.1 million oz.

The JP Morgan vault would be the total of JP Morgan, the bank's silver, and customer silver. Typically JP Morgan's house account doesn't keep much silver in registered so this move out today is likely silver owned by customer accounts.

A couple of weeks ago I had written that I identified BofA as removing vast quantities of gold, 25.9 tonne, from registered at JP Morgan's vault.  This could be BofA's silver.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another\_75\_tonne\_of\_gold\_moved\_out\_of\_jp\_morgans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13snvww/another_75_tonne_of_gold_moved_out_of_jp_morgans/)

&#x200B;

JP Morgan's eligible metal stands at 133.3 million oz. From that, deduct the 103 million oz that is ""owned"" by SLV's authorized participants (and probably a few other parties) which leaves 30.3 million oz. Again, that would be the total of customer and the bank's silver.

I had documented the occasions where it became apparent that the JP Morgan, the bank, was out of silver during 2022 although they have likely restocked to some extent. I always pay special attention to JP Morgan as they are the cabal's lead banker.

Today's comex total of 27.3 million oz is a 6.5 year low last seen in December 29, 2016.

The record low was just 6 months earlier at 22,482,450 oz which occurred for a 7 day stretch ending June 14, 2016.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  July silver contracts

Yesterday I mentioned there was a surge in ""privately negotiated trades"" on the upcoming July silver contract which arrested the two week surge in open interest.  The heightened PNT trades continued with 3,361 contracts. Despite that the total OI had a modest gain of 1,266 contracts:

It is interesting to note that the July contract OI at day 9 is 12.5 times the registered vault total, and that is the highest in the post covid era. But you should skip this plot too:

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold Vaults

There was a large move out of the gold vaults at JP Morgan's vaults, 221 koz or 6.86 tonne. That's 2.5% of JP Morgan's vault total and 1% of comex total.

A couple of weeks ago I documented huge moves at JP Morgan's gold vault as metal  moved out of registered. Now it appears that it is going out of the vault.

On May 23 and 24 there were 589 koz or 18.3 tonne moved out of registered. I posted an analysis that showed that the likely perp was almost certainly BofA. They are the only party that has net stopped that much gold, specifically 30.5 tonne since March 30 of this year and 124 tonne over the last 2-1/2 years.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147\_tonne\_vacates\_jp\_morgans\_comex\_gold\_vault/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147_tonne_vacates_jp_morgans_comex_gold_vault/)

Since those moves out of registered, JP Morgan's gold vault has been fairly quiet. It isn't a certainty that this is BofA's gold that was 1) recently bought at comex and 2) moved out of registered and 3) now moved out of the vault. But it is likely. 

If it is BofA's gold, this 6.86 tonne would represent 38% of the that 18.3 tonne moved out of registered on May 23 and 23. We may get some clarity in the days ahead if there is a follow up move(s) out of the vault.

Why care? BofA has been a huge buyer of gold at comex over the last 2-1/2 years. They have bought a net 4.0 million oz (124 tonne). IF (notice that is in uppercase), all of that was in JP Morgan's vault, that would represent 80% of the JP Morgan vault total. Yesterday's move of 6.86 tonne is only 6% of BofA's net stopped gold. How's that for an avalanche waiting to fall?

The numbers to the oz:

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Silver Vaults

A truckload (640 koz) was deposited at Loomis' vault and a half truckload departed Brinks for a net increase of 361 koz:

No change in registered, and even with 6 continuous days of no change in registered. That is no big deal.

I hear that yesterday one of my (blocked) trolls on Twitter is making a deal about there being 5 days of no change in registered silver. BFD. In fact, it is the 4th time **this year** that has occurred.  Even after yesterday's 6th day in a row of no change, a continuous 6 day span has happened **3 times this year**.

It's still about 10 days too early to look at the countdown to first notice on the July silver contract, however I can't help but notice that the OI decline is less than average:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atgitobcd16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e3d70dae95e6edc754db1b3bb6e117997dcade

This next plot is the daily change in OI ... essentially the derivative of the plot above. Note that the daily decline is running a couple of thousand contracts per day below average.

https://preview.redd.it/9cxkl8tdd16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=f30b6ba11498d193f4569daba0f8ba705a96491e

Meanwhile traders are flooding into the September contract causing a surge in total OI. See the plot below.

Note the blue line for the May 23 contract also experienced an OI surge at this point in the cycle. I'll have to think about why they are mirroring each other.

https://preview.redd.it/8fxlgoi1g16b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45b37db55b061074291ccbba31deea21f3235e4

Yesterday the OI increase for the September contract (7,296) was more than double the decline for July (3,167). Usually, during the core of the roll, these are offsetting. The total OI increase is 4,382.

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    comex vaults

Yesterday was ""take it away Tuesday"" at the comex vaults. One truckload (600 koz) departed JP Morgan and Loomis' vaults, 476 koz was out of Delaware Depository and 100 koz was out of CNT. All of that was somewhat offset by a 487 koz deposit at JP Morgan and 300 koz at Brinks.

The net change was 978 koz OUT OF THE VAULT:

https://preview.redd.it/ht16uy1nh16b1.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=a01f6d1361ea8579346c19f2e7841b9f18279476

&#x200B;

But that was nothing compared to gold.  Brinks' gold vault saw a 162 koz or 5.0 tonne departure. That is 3.4% of Brinks' vault total.

Scrolling back in time, Brinks had a 367 koz move out of registered on May 30, just a couple of weeks ago. That date was first notice day on the June contract so I have to try to pair that move with a gold buyer. However, nobody stopped that much gold, so I can't point the finger at anyone specifically. The largest buyer(s) that day were JP Morgan customer accounts at 353 koz ... fairly close. It is possible the vault move was JP Morgan customer account gold.

Here was the detail from that day:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely\_odd\_day\_for\_comex\_silver\_all\_just\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13wxiud/extremely_odd_day_for_comex_silver_all_just_to/)

Here we are 10 biz days later and 162 koz moves out of the vault. It's logical to connect those, although that is not certain. Perhaps that 5 tonne will show up at JP Morgan's vault or perhaps another large comex player is buying gold at comex, moving it out of registered and then OUT OF THE VAULT.

Asahi, the new vault, showed a 48 koz deposit.

JP Morgan,"Did JP Morgan Chase just get a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout to make it a bigger systemic risk so that the global financial system must bail them out?","Did JP Morgan Chase just get a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout to make it a bigger systemic risk so that the global financial system must bail them out? According to the list of global systemically important banks ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_systemically_important_banks), [Financial Stability Board (FSB)](https://www.fsb.org/2022/11/2022-list-of-global-systemically-important-banks-g-sibs/), [FSB PDF](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P211122.pdf)), JP Morgan Chase is top dog as the *only Tier 4* bank.  (The higher the tier, the more systemic risk the bank poses to the financial system so the required capital buffer is higher at each tier.)

>A systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis). They are colloquially referred to as ""[**too big to fail**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail)"". \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution)\]

According to the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements), which has a [dashboard](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/) showing scores and components for Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs), JP Morgan Chase is by itself in Tier 4 with the highest overall risk rating as the most interconnected bank with the most complex banking relationships.

[Global systemically important banks: assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement \(Nov 2022\)](https://preview.redd.it/tptv8xjx39xa1.png?width=1109&format=png&auto=webp&s=a427e29b63440f39891c6b714e224dd88fe39e25)

***If*** **JP Morgan Chase were to fail, the financial system would be at high risk of a financial crisis.**  *Which means JPM Chase is in an interesting position because the global financial system is both incentivized to keep JPM from failing and, if an institution is to fail, putting the most complex and interconnected financial institution at risk* ***maximizes the likelihood of another bailout***.

Some of you may remember from 2 years ago (April 15, 2021) that JP Morgan sold $13B in bonds in the largest bank deal ever at the time ([SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt6bju/why_banks_randomly_decided_to_sell_billions_in/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/jpmorgan-to-sell-13-billion-of-bonds-in-largest-bank-sale-ever)) to raise money.  The next day, Bank of America takes the lead by selling $15B worth of bonds ([SuperStonk DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsioql/the_complete_bank_of_america_gamestop_dd/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/bofa-to-set-record-for-largest-bank-bond-sale-at-15-billion#xj4y7vzkg), April 16, 2021).

So if JP Morgan needed to raise some serious money *without getting a bailout*, buying another bank in a sweetheart deal seems like another way to juice up JP Morgan's balance sheet with some good PR. According to [CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/01/business/first-republic-purchase-hnk-intl/index.html),

>First Republic ... had assets of **$229.1 billion** as of April 13. As of the end of last year, it was the nation’s **14th-largest bank**, according to a ranking by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States with total global assets of **nearly $4 trillion** as of March 31.

Now that JP Morgan picked up First Republic, their total assets increases by about $229B (about 5.7%).  And, according to Reuters \[[Factbox](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-deal-collapsed-first-republic-explained-2023-05-01/)\], JP Morgan just got a pretty sweet deal with First Republic Bank:

* JPMorgan Chase will pay **$10.6 billion** to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC)
* Will **not** assume First Republic's corporate **debt** or preferred stock
* FDIC to provide [loss share agreements](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/) with respect to most acquired loans

So JP Morgan paid $10.6B to pick up $229B (less than 5c on the dollar), passes on the corporate debt, and shares losses with the FDIC so that:

* JPMorgan expects one-time gain of **$2.6 billion** post-tax at closing
* Estimated to add roughly **$500 million to net income** and be accretive to tangible book value per share

**That's a pretty damn good deal.**  Let's look more into what the FDIC says about [shared loss agreements (SLA)](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/lossshare/).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/jqe3z9ira9xa1.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=cefb80e4cb215985e0ac3c5836fe1c77316b7b7e)

The FDIC absorbs a portion of the loss on assets sold through resolving a failed bank ""sharing the loss with the purchaser of the failed bank"".  *Sounds like the FDIC just took one for the team.*

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/7qob3s6qb9xa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bfd02469344d43cef0f50540691e63c9c08b22a)

According to the FDIC, loss sharing is basically an 80/20 split (except for after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis when the split was 95/5, which has ended).

[FDIC FAQ on Shared Loss Agreements](https://preview.redd.it/alkxtvz6c9xa1.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d900e614b00abc103fb360936f421a708a047e2)

According to the FDIC, resolving a failed bank with loss sharing is supposed to be based on **the least costly option** (to the Deposit Insurance Fund).  (We've seen this least costly option come up in resolving bank failures before with the FDIC and Federal Reserve contemplating requiring Too Big To Fail banks sell destined-to-fail bonds to absorb losses and reduce payouts by the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund \[[SuperStonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/zdebh6/comment_against_the_federal_reserve_fdic_proposal/)\])

According to [Investopedia, JPMorgan To Pay FDIC $10.6 Billion For First Republic, This is What It Gets](https://www.investopedia.com/what-does-jpmorgan-get-in-first-republic-deal-7487296), resolving FRC bank failure will cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $13B.

>The FDIC will take a **$13 billion hit to its fund** and *provide $50 billion in financing*.

Wait, the **FDIC is providing $50B to finance JPM buying FRC?!**

https://preview.redd.it/4j4du9umk9xa1.png?width=3492&format=png&auto=webp&s=33069c143c5351f6b2e616e6c826fc543090e181

The FDIC loaned JP Morgan $50B to buy the failed First Republic bank for $10.6B.  $30B of that was used to repay a [rescue deal from March (last month)](https://www.investopedia.com/first-republic-s-usd30b-rescue-by-jp-morgan-citi-and-bank-of-america-7367932) backed by JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.  Which means JP Morgan gets their money back from the previous rescue *plus* an **extra $9.4B** out of this loan deal to buy $229B worth of assets from First Republic.

On top of that, JP Morgan splits losses with the FDIC 80/20 with the FDIC covering 80% of loan losses for the next 5-7 years (5 years for commercial loans and 7 years for residential mortgages).

**Imagine if a bank** ***loans you*** **$9,400 to buy a $229,000 house.**  No down payment.  Just ""here's $9,400 and the keys to that $229,000 house"". Oh, and the bank will cover 80% of the cost for anything that breaks in the house for the next 5-7 years.  *This is an insane deal.*

**Which truly makes one wonder if this is a ""not-a-bailout"" bailout for JP Morgan,** the *only* Tier 4 GSIB as the most interconnected bank with the most complex banking relationships and the highest overall systemic risk rating.

Are we going to see:

1. Fat bonuses at JP Morgan?
2. Followed by news about JP Morgan posing a systemic risk?
3. Followed by calls to bail out JP Morgan to save pensions?

JP Morgan,"19 States accused JP Morgan on closing accounts on religious or political beliefs. This is exactly why anonymity and privacy is so important in crypto as a future of finance and potential TradFi and banking replacement/improvement, as well as the significance of decentralization","19 States accused JP Morgan on closing accounts on religious or political beliefs. This is exactly why anonymity and privacy is so important in crypto as a future of finance and potential TradFi and banking replacement/improvement, as well as the significance of decentralization 19 states have come out accusing JP Morgan of of closing accounts and discriminating against customers due to their political or religious beliefs. A letter to JP Morgan said ""the bank had canceled major organizations' checking accounts and  had asked screening questions focused on religion and politics before  reinstating them"" JPMorgan also allegedly declined a proposal on participation in a  survey for the Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index, which is meant to determine ""freedom of expression and freedom of religion or  belief as a standard part of doing business,"". JPMorgan had received a score of 15% for the index in 2022 which obviously shows their massive bias and give credibility to the claims.

It's significant enough that JP Morgan would randomly close accounts, and defenders would have said it's due to anti-money laundering politcies/bank secrecy act etc, absolutely ridiculous and makes their intentions clear when they ask questions that screen customers religious and political beliefs before customers have just a *chance* to get their accounts reinstated.

There's been a bit of a push and pull in crypto whereby some people disagree with the need to anonymity. I'd argue that these are privileged people who've had no issues with banks having their information, but they only had no issues because they had money, which the bank wanted. The government view of crypto regulation is definitely to peel back that anonymity as far back as they can. But this situation shows exaclly why anonymity is important, as it immediately solves problems of discrimination as well as safety of the individuals as well so as not to become target, either of societal or corporate discrimination, or criminals.

And crypto balances it very well with allowing *privacy* but not *confidentiality*. Privacy means a lack of direct intrusion into private or personal affairs, so an anonymous blockchain has privacy, but not confidentiality.  This as confidentiality deals more with a complete block of access to information like the government sealing documents and offering no access at all.

It also ties right back into decentralization, where no centralized entity has the power to deny access to services on the blockchain. We all know that power corrupts and JP Morgan has way too much of that. Instead we have a decentralized blockchain where it would take a (mostly) democratic process to deny access to services, and even then it's pretty rare.

Plus JP Morgan adds another truckload for the 5th day in a row. The upcoming inactive June silver contract's open interest continues to drift upwards despite the chaos on the gold contracts. It now stands at 1,120 contracts. Typically nearly all of the OI of these inactive month contracts stand for delivery. First notice day is in 7 days.

I've rarely mentioned the micro silver contract. The ticker is SIL and it is a 1,000 oz deliverable contract. A guy on twitter, [@EsScalping](https://twitter.com/EsScalping), pointed out that there is also an ""E-mini"" silver contract. That ticker is QI and is for 2,500 oz but is only financially settled. You can't get silver on QI so it'll never impact comex vault totals.

Back to the SIL 1,000 oz micro contract. I mentioned yesterday that what's been happening is the CME group is making a market in the SIL contract.

Essentially there are three fairly big buyers and no sellers. The CME folks buy metal on the 5,000 oz SI contract and sell it to those 3 players on the 1,000 oz SIL contract.

I should probably say, I'm referring to the physical market ... those that stand for delivery. There may be others trading paper contracts, but I can't identify them.  I'm addressing the names I see on the issues and stops report for physical metal.

The CME group has sold 21.44 million oz net since 2019 and those three customer accounts have bought 21.42 million oz. The cumulative net tally for each is as follows:

There's been a few bubbas that have occasionally stopped contracts, but you can see it is round off.

When the CME folks buy metal at the SI contract, it is essentially like some combination of these 3 customer accounts buying it. The metal just passes through, usually the same day.

Below are plots of the issues, stops and net for 1) the CME group, and 2) the largest buyer, Advantage customer accounts. Note that Advantage has rarely sold any silver.

I've considered adding the two contracts (SI and SIL) together for my graphics. The only reason I haven't is that the reader will have a difficult time tracking the raw numbers from the report to the graphs. Personally, I like to do that when viewing plots to gain confidence in the data. For now, I haven't added them. Currently, some of the larger issues and stops from the SIL contract are greater than the smaller, inactive months, on the SI contract. So I may start adding them for plots in the future.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold

The gold open interest fell another 11,345 contracts and has now given back much of the OI surge that occurred 2 weeks ago:

The June active month is 7 days to first notice and has now fallen below the average:

Over lunch today I listened to a podcast that mentioned an increase in gold EFP (exchange for physical) volume. EFP's are a swap of a comex futures contract with a ""physical"" contract in London. Settlement by EFP rarely induces metal leaving London vaults.

As far as an EFP surge, I'm not seeing it. I track the cumulative EFP volume after zeroing the meter at day 44 (the start of the OI plateau). See the plot below. The June gold contract was riding the average line (the bold black line ) until recently and then drifted slightly below trend.

That said, the number of contracts that routinely vacate comex by EFP is huge. Usually it exceeds the total gold in registered as you can see below. The current registered gold is shown as the horizontal green line.

Another truckload arrived at JP Morgan's vault. That's a truckload in each of the last 5 days at JP Morgan's vault.

Yesterday I forgot to mention that the new vault operated by Asahi Depository, showed 1.2 million oz moved to registered and that is added to the comex vault registered total.

The day prior's statement for Asahi had all zeros. It was odd that their account statement didn't show metal being present the day before or being ""received"" on yesterday's report.  It just showed the ""adjustment"", which is the move to registered. Typically a move to registered has a deduct from eligible. Essentially, it just magically arrived.

Magic accounting. I wonder what's actually in Asahi's vault?

JP Morgan,📰 History Repeating – Jp Morgan & Rothschilds Redux,"📰 History Repeating – Jp Morgan & Rothschilds Redux **HISTORY REPEATING – JP MORGAN & ROTHSCHILDS REDUX** 

Little bit of a history of the gold/silver standard and what amounted to the Panic of 1896.  What’s interesting in this history lesson are the players and what they were trying to achieve – Rothschild and JP Morgan.  130 years later the same lessons are being told but the main players have not changed and the ultimate gain is banking as opposed to railway. 

JP Morgans undocumented manipulation of the gold and silver market has long been a speculated rumour and somewhat difficult thing to prove. So today we thought we’d take you on a journey back to 1895 – where speculation and government collusion were in fact tools used by JP Morgan and Rothschilds to both save the US from economic collapse and line their own pockets.  The result was the strengthening of these financial institutions, which over the years have used the same playbook to further enhance their market dominance and back-handed deals rewarding and not punishing their financial prowess.

The playbook? Wait for the government to fall into a panic or a financial crisis. Save the day. Manipulate markets to your advantage, and walk away with monopolistic powers.  In 1914 JP Morgan emerged as the major player and owner of railways in the US.  2023 JP Morgan emerges as the major player in US banking.  Both a mechanism of trade control – 1914 Industrial revolution trade control and 2023 banking and finance trade control.

**What’s a Panic?**

Rather than googling financial crisis – google panic, Pre-1900 the panic terminology appears to apply to any bubble or distorted market leading to market manipulation and panic, otherwise now known as a financial crisis.  Some examples include:

**Panic of 1819**

This was the first US widespread panic, driven by the end of the Napoleonic wars, it was compounded by asset bubbles in speculation in public lands – fueled by the unrestrained issue of ‘paper money’

**Panic of 1837**

Another panic set off from a real estate bubble and erratic American banking policy. Deflation set in with profit, prices and wages dropping.

**Panic of 1873**

This panic started in Europe with a stock market crash leading to investors liquidating bonds, in particular railway bonds in the US due to overdevelopment and speculation in railway.

**The Panic of 1893 and 1896**

Triggered by factors such as a failed coup in Argentina, a run on gold in the U.S. Treasury, and an oversupply of silver.

You see the gist here – gets a little 1800 repetitive and it was no wonder property prices remained fairly subdued throughout the 19th Century. It appears in the 20th Century, those Panic lessons may have been well and truly forgotten and the same old real estate lax banking bubbles emerged.

But for this history lesson we will focus on 1873 and 1893, and the great fortune JP Morgan was able to accumulate during this time and the role of gold and bonds that saw JP Morgan emerge as the US’s most powerful financial and railroad tycoon.

**Railroad Playbook**

JP Morgan cofounded Drexel, Morgan and company in 1871, becoming JP Morgan and company in 1895.  What seemed like a bad time to be in business turned out to be fortuitous to JP Morgan.  The Panic of 1873 started with the rampant inflation driven from overspeculation in railroads and the demonetization of silver in Germany and the US.  Following the American Civil War, 33,000 miles of railroad were built between 1868 and 1873.  Within the railroad craze a large infusion of cash was raised via bonds.  In 1871 Germany demonetized silver leading to an oversupply of silver, particularly in the US who mined most of the supply.  In 1873 the US passed the Coinage Act of 1873 backing the US dollar to a de facto gold standard.   This immediately depressed silver prices further, reduced money supply and raised interest rates hurting farmers.  People then shied away from long term bonds and collapsed the railway bond market.

In 1873 the precipice of the Panic happened when Jay Cooke and Company couldn’t sell millions of dollars of Northern Pacific Railway Bonds leading to its bankruptcy. By 1874 60 railroads had gone bankrupt 

In 1875 Congress backed the USD with gold helping to curb and stabilize the dollar.

It was 10 years after the collapse in railway bonds that JP Morgan emerged as a railway force, this time reorganizing railways, merging them and taking stakes, such as in 1885 when he arranged a merger between New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad.  

**Morgan-Belmont Syndicate**

Following the 1893 Panic, paper money was being exchanged for gold from treasury, draining the US Treasury of gold.  The hot money movement as it was later known had all the hallmarks of a self compelling bank run on Treasury due to a distrust of the US government’s gold reserve.  There was a rapid decline in gold reserves from $121,0000,000 on January 1st 1893 to $66,000,000 on February 1st 1894.  Under these circumstances the government used 4 subscriptions of $50,000,000 of 5% 10 year bonds over a 1894-1895.  But each time treasury again saw gold continue to pour out of treasury.  Speculative international transactions prompted by the fear of the ceasing of the gold standard saw another net outflow of $84,000,000 between October 1894 and January 1895, investors were liquidating bank balances and railroad bonds for gold and sending this gold to Europe at an increasing rate.

To assist with the US predicament a famous meeting between President Cleveland and JP Morgan in 1895 produced a syndicate and its contract on February 8th 1895.  The contract failed to name syndicate members with a veil of secrecy, although it is now known the syndicate included both Rothschilds and JP Morgan to name some of the more notable firms.  The contract was for the syndicate to bolster gold stock and stop outflows. The syndicate agreed to purchase 3,500,000 ounces of gold and sell it to the government with 4% 30 year bonds.  

The syndicate acquired $62,315,400 in government bonds at a 4% return, which they sold at 3 ¾% almost immediately for $68,833,591 – a tidy $5,000,000 immediate profit. Additional to the gold they delivered, within a week the syndicate saw other gold inflows of $10,000,000 from domestic holders.

The second condition was the syndicate exert control on the market (manipulate) to stop gold outflows.  The syndicate contract lasted 6 months, with the Syndicate manipulating control over the exchange rate to ensure enhanced profits from the arrangements

*‘The unique and imprecise manner by which authority was delegated by the government to a private syndicate to control the foreign-exchange market would be unthinkable in modern time’*

During this time it was also identified that the syndicate used moral suasion (more manipulation) to ensure other gold holders/investors did not withdraw further gold.  They appealed to these investors by giving bonds at preferential terms they would adhere to the ‘ship no gold’ agreement. Articles at the time supported the Syndicate and the moral suasion such as the United States Investor revered the Syndicate for stopping the previous deflation 

‘*To those persons to criticize the bond syndicate for keeping the price of the exchange at such high figures, it is sufficient to say that had the Syndicate not intervened, the cost of paying debts cold be even greater than at present, because gold would be in transit instead of exchange.’*

The Syndicate succeeded in reinvigorating faith in the US government and dollar and saw a period of prosperity follow, but it seems from this point the US Government owed the architects of the syndicate a favour.   And it appears during this time the Syndicate learnt the economic benefits of precious metal manipulation.

The end of the agreement saw Europe liquidate some of these railway bonds, which we’re sure became the icing on JP Morgans Railway cake as he emerged in 1902 as the largest US railway owner, controlling 5,000 miles of US railroads.

**JP Morgan and First Republic Bank today**

We all know this more recent story of JP Morgans takeover of multiple banks – Bear Sterns, First Republic Bank with the government again leaning on the financial Behemoth to help save the US dollar.  But just like in 1895 the favors and profits to be made are enhancing both the strength and influence of JP Morgan. 

During the First Republic deal laws were broken and profits were made, putting JP Morgan in a stronger monopolistic position in US banking, just like the railways in 1902.

The US law that needed to be circumvented, as JPMorgan ‘*is so big that by* **law it would not be allowed to buy First Republic** *because no one bank can have more than a 10 per cent market’*

And the profit made by JP Morgan: *‘Recognize an upfront, one-time, post-tax gain of approximately $2.6 billion, which does not reflect the approximately $2.0 billion dollars of post-tax restructuring costs anticipated over the next 18 months’*

History Repeats.

**Finally just a little bit of 2023/1873 comparison**

* 1998 tech boom leading to the 2000 collapse- with overinvestment and hype in a new technology – railway vs internet (Panic of 1873)
* 2008 Financial Crisis and deflation (Panic of 1895)
* And finally 2022 inflation, 14 years after the GFC, bought on by Covid, compared  the 1917  during and proceeding World War 1. With inflation in 1920 hitting 25% and 1921 a sharp reversal -15% so will we see a similar pattern in 2024/2025?

JP Morgan,14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect.,"14.7 tonne vacates JP Morgan's comex gold vault. Comex forensics ... I know the primary suspect. Excuse me ... change that headline to registered vault. No hyperbole intended. On with the show ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A huge move, 14.7 tonne or 471,000 oz, is out of registered gold on today's vault report ... all of it out of JP Morgan's vault.

Often, but not always, metal moved out of registered ends up being moved out of the vault soon thereafter. Time will tell on that. Regardless, it is a move away from being sold at comex. The size of the move is noteworthy.

Inquiring minds want to know ... who did it? Obviously, it could be any of the comex players who had 14.7 tonne or more in JP Morgan's vault. But that rules out a lot of entities.

I can guess who may be on that short list based on who bought gold recently from JP Morgan or JP Morgan customer accounts. If they stopped metal from those players, the gold would reside in JP Morgan's vault.

Recall that on March 30 of this year JP Morgan issued delivery notices on 10,682 gold contracts. That's 33.2 tonne of gold. I'm talking the house account. The bank. They had shorted gold like f'ing hell during the $150 March rally in an attempt to defend the cabal's fiat. If they hadn't gold would have gone up a lot more than $150.

Here's the procedure to guess who removed the metal: 

Since the metal is in JP Morgan's vault, I looked at all the gold sold by JP Morgan and its customer accounts only. Scrolling back through time, those entities sold 320,000 oz or 3.82 tonne from March 31 onward ... not enough to source today's vault departure.

In other words, if this is metal was bought recently, it would have to include part of the 33.2 tonne sold by JP Morgan's house account on March 30. 

That's extremely interesting. That was an epic sale by JP Morgan. It was the largest sale ever for them, and now it may be involved in metal moving out of comex.

Next, I looked at who stopped (bought) that 33.2 tonne JP Morgan sold on March 30. While you typically don't know which short's metal went to which long, in this case JP Morgan accounted for 63% of the gold sold that day, so you can guess that the big buyers that day got a sizable piece of JP Morgan's metal.

Below are the players who stopped more than one tonne that day. The primary suspects from this list are BofA, Citi and Morgan Stanley customer accounts.

Next I looked at all the ***net*** metal stopped since March 30 by all comex players. This would be from any and all sellers. See the list below. Note that some of this metal may have been acquired from non-JP Morgan sellers, but it would be near impossible to screen further to who stopped metal from only JP Morgan's vault.

https://preview.redd.it/exdzw80fnv1b1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=56832df2c8b05b5875e7984557805b7f5a5634d2

Note that Citi isn't on the list as they sold all of the metal bought on March 30 (plus another 5%). So Citi is off the suspect list and the list is down to 2.

Morgan Stanley customers acquired 8.1 tonne on March 30 and another 1.8 tonne after March 30. Their accrued net purchase since March 30 is 9.9 tonne. It IS possible that they moved their newly bought 9.9 tonne plus another 4.8 tonne they had bought previously, but this is less likely. Furthermore, this all assumes that Morgan Stanley customers are all acting together, or are (mostly) one entity.  I think they are a long shot.

That leaves BofA. What about them?

BofA stopped 13.6 tonne on March 30 and another 16.9 tonne since for a total of 30.5 tonne. Furthermore, they haven't sold **any** gold at all over the last 4 months which is an indication of the direction of their intent ... not flipping metal. The accumulated gold bought since March 30 far surpasses today's vault move of 14.7 tonne. They are the lead suspect.

Who'dve thunk. It wasn't Putin or Xi after all.

The possibility that one of comex's biggest gold players is buying metal and removing it from (at least) registered, is significant. BofA has bought a net 125 tonne since becoming active in early 2021. If this 14.7 tonne is their metal, that would be 12% of their stack.  And maybe more is going out!

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Silver Vaults

JP Morgan did NOT move a truckload into the vaults today, unlike the prior 7 days. Perhaps their silver stack rebuild is complete at 4.2 million oz. If so, that is nothing like the volumes they could effortlessly deliver with the click of the mouse, like 30 million oz at a time. That was before they were downgraded to jay pee pee.

A net 340,000 oz is out of the vault and 400,000 oz was moved out of registered at JP Morgan's vault. BofA?

The June inactive month silver contract is counting down to first notice day with 5 (biz) days to go. The OI has stabilized at 1,133 contracts or about 5.5 million oz. Just noticing that the SIL contract (the 1,000 oz micro) has about 1.2 million oz ready to stand for delivery too.

Back to just the SI contract ... while that OI plots as near the average of prior contracts (shown below on the countdown plot), it is much greater than recent months.

Plus, as a fraction of registered silver, it's one of the highest months over the last 3 years. At the current OI, it accounts for 18.5% of registered whereas the average inactive month (at day 5) is 7.3%:

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Gold

Gold contracts continue to close with the total OI declining 6,192 contracts. Based on recent price activity, you'd assume this is being driven by longs closing contracts.

The June contract is now rolling to August, so I track the OI with the sum of the two:

Based on the June countdown plot, it would appear that of the roll pair contracts (June and August) most of the reduction is in the August contract. I say that because the June contract is 16,000 below the mean, whereas the sum of the two is 39,000 below the mean. The June contract OI is as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/jdk80qrswm1b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=40e5fdb3603b296e3f830848ef2a8677fb016523

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver Vaults

For the 7th day in a row a truckload was received at JP Morgan's vault. If you've not yet been enlightened, a truckload in my jargon is 600,000 oz. A lot of comex silver moves in lots of 600k. That is also a typical payload that can be moved by most class 8 trucks in the USA. Converted to lbs that is 41,000. And for you people that haven't yet converted, that is 18,800 kilos.

So that is now 4.2 million oz of newly arrived metal at JP Morgan's vault over the last 7 days. This is not unlike JP Morgan's restocking of 30 tonne of gold with 6 deposits between March 31 and May 2.

Today, however, the 600k oz deposit at JP Morgan was offset by a 1.1 million oz move out of the vault. Furthermore, 35,000 oz was transferred out of registered at JP Morgan's vault.

For the totals of all 10 comex vaults,  600k was moved in, 2.5 million oz was moved out for a net decline of 1.9 million oz. Also 280,000 oz was moved out of registered to eligible.

The gold vaults saw 1 even tonne move into Brinks:

The comex gold contracts had another large reduction in open interest dropping by 10,886 contracts. Give it a yawn. That is typical for this point in the cycle (2 days to first notice).  Basically, there are a lot of folks who hang around with about 5 or 6 days to go who are not hedgers. They are arbs or folks trying to pick up some fiat as the herd rolls or closes. They just close without rolling.

The raw numbers:

That 10,886 decline drops the OI well below the pre-OI surge level from about 3 weeks ago:

https://preview.redd.it/xjbmrdinq92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6adea51f149847d74ad0d99d96b7581023a865f

Currently we are in the last days of the roll period from the June contract to the August contract. See the OI countdown plot below. The number of contracts that closed on the June contract was 42,498 which is exactly the average.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8xkqppht92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=aced6c293570491b5b3faa1f8cb908fc879e22ac

What happened, and almost always happens at this point, is that many of those contracts didn't roll to August. They just closed. The new August contracts totaled 31,219 or 11,279 less. However, this 11,279 is routine for day 2. In fact usually it is even greater at 14,500.

&#x200B;

The June contract OI is now 58% of registered metal in the vault:

https://preview.redd.it/wr5tgow8t92b1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e979180681727b76d38dc43ce874581637c24fb

Moving on the the gold vaults ...  the story at JP Morgan's vault is more bizarre. There was an additional 242,611 oz (or 7.5 tonne) moved out of JP Morgan's vault. This time the move was from the 400 oz vault.

You may recall the March 2020 near crack up at comex. In an effort to add physical supply, comex changed its rules such that contracts could be settled with 400 oz bars in addition the the usual 100 oz bars. An additional category was added to the vault report specifically for the 400 oz bars.

Considering all of comex (not just JP Morgan), as of yesterday's report only 242,611 oz or 2% of comex registered gold consisted of 400 oz bars. That gives some indication of how many settlements consist of 400 oz bars. Eligible gold consisted of 3,895,686 oz (or 35%) in 400 oz bars.

Therefore, this 242,611 oz move from registered to eligible zeros out comex registered in the 400 oz bar category.

&#x200B;

Was that 242,611 oz move on today's report also BofA?   Over the two prior days BofA (at least it is a high probability it was BofA) moved 18.3 tonne out of JP Morgan's registered (in the 100 oz vault). I'd bet that it was BofA which would bring their 3 day move out of registered to 25.9 tonne.

Moving on to other vault changes ... there was also a 250,778 oz (7.8 tonne) move *into* registered at JP Morgan's vault.

Since that is all getting complicated, I'll cut and paste the raw report for the JP Morgan portion of the vault report:

&#x200B;

I doubt that BofA is moving metal out of, and then back into, registered. So I don't think this is connected to the discussion above. I suspect that we will see someone issue 2,510 contracts early next week.  I'll wait until then to see who's name is printed on the issues and stops report. I have a premonition who that may be.

&#x200B;

Other vault moves ... one tonne into MTB's vault. And the net of all that is ...

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Silver

First notice day on the June inactive silver contract is also Monday. FYI ... FND of gold and silver contracts are always synced. The June silver open interest continues flat at 1,114 contracts or 5.57 million oz. Another 1.34 million oz is about to stand for delivery on the micro contract for a total of 6.91 million oz. That'll require 23% of the registered silver.

Speaking of the vault, registered dropped below 30 million oz again. 600 k is out of registered at MTB and 300 k out at HSBC.

The new vault, Asahi, showed 600 k oz arriving with a small offset of 55 k oz departing. The net of all that is ...

Another big day at the gold vaults. There was followup from yesterday's huge move with an additional 118,000 oz or 3.7 tonne moving out of registered at JP Morgan's vault. That is on top of yesterday's 471,000 oz or 14.7 tonne bringing the 2 day total to 18.3 tonne. 

So far, none of that metal has left the vault ... according to the vault reports.

In yesterday's piece, I showed analysis that points the finger at BofA for being the responsible party. You gotta read daily as I can't keep a post concise and repeat the relevant history: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147\_tonne\_vacates\_jp\_morgans\_comex\_gold\_vault/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverDegenClub/comments/13qxc60/147_tonne_vacates_jp_morgans_comex_gold_vault/)

These new vault withdrawal numbers are completely consistent with my BofA guess. In fact, strengthens the BofA case because the alternatives had bought much less than BofA recently. Yesterday I mentioned that there is a lot more where that came from ... and there still is.

Separately, there was a 7.0 tonne deposit at Malca Amit's vault. That is a 35% increase. I don't have any recon on who that could be, but I suspect their name will be on the issues and stops report on Monday.

The upcoming June gold contract is an active month and with first notice day on Monday. The OI trajectory has been declining less than usual the last few days as you can see in the plot below.

Usually the number of contracts standing for delivery ranges from 10-20%. Apparently the gold vaults are managed with more cushion than the silver vaults. Why? Probably because a delivery miss on gold would be game over.

The daily change in OI of the front month contract is shown below. It's the derivative of the plot above. Note that today's trading, day 2 before first notice day, usually has the largest decline in OI.

As the June contract appears at the average (bold black line) on the first plot, when adjusted for the reduction in registered gold, the OI is one of the higher contracts. The June contract has 95% of registered gold compared to the average of 75%.

The OI on the June silver contract, an inactive month, is holding around 1,120 contracts. Traders generally don't roll on inactive month contracts which is why the OI isn't plunging like the active month gold contract.

JP Morgan,Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank,"Blackrock and JP Morgan help set up Ukrainian reconstruction bank BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are helping the Ukrainian government set up a reconstruction bank to steer public seed capital into rebuilding projects that can attract hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment.

The Ukraine Development Fund remains in the planning stages and is not expected to fully launch until the end of hostilities with Russia. But investors will have a preview this week at a London conference co-hosted by the British and Ukrainian governments.

“So many of today’s long-term challenges are best addressed through blended finance and this is one. You need these vehicles to mobilise capital at scale,” said BlackRock vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand, who will be discussing the work on Wednesday.

The World Bank estimated in March that Ukraine would need $411bn to rebuild after the war, and recent Russian attacks have driven that figure higher.

The Kyiv government engaged BlackRock’s consulting arm in November to determine how best to attract that kind of capital, and then added JPMorgan in February. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced last month that the country was working with the two financial groups and consultants at McKinsey.

No formal fundraising target has been set but people familiar with the discussions say the fund is seeking to raise low-cost capital from governments, donors and international financial institutions and leverage it to attract between five and 10 times as much private investment.

BlackRock and JPMorgan are donating their services, although the work will give them an early look at possible investments in the country. The assignment also deepens JPMorgan’s relationship with a longstanding client. The bank has helped Ukraine raise more than $25bn in sovereign debt since 2010 and led the country’s $20bn debt restructuring last year.

The financiers consulted with private and public sector investors and found they wanted to help Ukraine but were leery not just about war losses but also the country’s governance, lack of transparency and shallow capital markets.

What Ukraine needed, BlackRock advised, was a development finance bank to find investment opportunities in sectors such as infrastructure, climate and agriculture and make them attractive to pension funds and other long-term investors and lenders. JPMorgan was brought in partly for its debt expertise.

“The fund is being set up to also give public and private sector investors the opportunity to invest into specific projects and sectors,” said Stefan Weiler, JPMorgan’s head of debt capital markets for central Europe, Middle East and Africa. “There will be different sectoral funds that the fund identified as priorities for Ukraine. The aim is maximise capital participation.”

The structure calls for the fund to use the lower-cost public money, known as concessional capital, to make initial investments and absorb the first losses.

The notion is that this initial seed capital would be a de-risking mechanism, and it would create the potential for private sector capital to come in at scale,” said Brandon Hall, co-head of BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory arm. “Ukraine will have its own organisation to source and syndicate these local investment opportunities.”

To overcome investor concerns about governance, the fund is expected to stock its board with representatives of international financial institutions and governments and hire investment professionals to execute its strategy.

“Our view is that if you have a strong governance structure and an internationally credible set of stakeholders who are in the leadership position in this fund, then that will go a long way,” Hall said",0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,0.8029,https://on.ft.com/443yCpg,06/20/2023,06:27:00,DoYouWant_the_Cheese,21,

JP Morgan is almost certainly restocking the silver vault with a third day in a row of a truckload deposit. Plus Degen ""erisorto"" wins the prize. Yesterday I was writing about the roll period where traders close their position on an upcoming active month contract and open a position in the next active month contract. A high fraction of contracts roll forward as such.

Furthermore, near the start of the roll period, there is a large increase in the number of TAS contracts on both the outgoing and incoming contracts. Basically, traders often utilize the trade at settlement (TAS) alternative to close and/or open their positions.

Below is a plot of the TAS volume for each contract. Focus on the pink shaded ""outgoing"" TAS period around day 17 to 8 days to first notice.

&#x200B;

It's not readily apparent on the above plot, but the TAS surge almost always lasts 5 continuous business days. Furthermore, it never starts on a Wednesday.

The question I asked was ... why doesn't the TAS surge start on Wednesdays?

FYI ... below are the stats on the start of the 5 day surge:

https://preview.redd.it/vzdenod4wf0b1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e04b0042f57f51528efc32e2f2f9e4b1253d7b

Of the 12,500 degenerates who read yesterday's post, only 1 person figured that out.

Aaaand the winner is ""erisorto"" of the SilverDegenClub:

https://preview.redd.it/ff9an4ydwf0b1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=427333350efa3556ba4ff6f365e2ae08816323f1

To add some commentary to erisorto's comments ...  a couple of months back, the sum total of the 5 day TAS surge was a lot less than usual. I thought I could then look at the CoT and see which category of trader had declined by comparing two subsequent CoT reports. If there was some correlation, that could infer which type of trader exploits TAS during those 5 days.

I then realized that that particular 5 day TAS period spanned 2 CoT reports. That fuzzes up the numbers because you then have to look at three subsequent reports to determine the changes.  It fuzzed things up enough that it wasn't apparent which category was involved.

I looked back through time and ALL of the TAS surge numbers spanned 2 reports. What a coincidink!

FYI ... the CoT report is based on traders position at the end of trading on Tuesday (and posted on Friday). The only way to get a clean week to week change between just 2 reports would be if the TAS surge started on a Wednesday. And that's why it never starts on Wednesday!

Everyone will want to start pointing fingers at the CME folks. However, note that the exchange has no rules or guidance about when to roll, or whether to use TAS or not. It's the traders themselves who decide. Apparently, the vast majority of traders decide to not roll their own position on Wednesdays. Furthermore, they mostly avoid Tuesday and Thursday because that splits the change at a 4:1 ratio (or 1:4). By rolling on Monday or Friday, the change is split by a 3:2 (or 2:3) for maximum obfuscation and that is what they do 75% of the time.

The traders are obfuscating data about themselves. The core driver of this is the weekly schedule of the CoT report with positions reported from the Tuesday close. It would be interesting to see if the CFTC required traders to report, say, twice a week. Would the traders modify their 5 day TAS surge?

Congrats to erisorto.  Comex traders have been parading him around the comex pits all day. He's got an interview on CNBC set for tomorrow morning at the opening bell, plus a visit to the White House later in the week.

And on with the new stuff:

Yesterday I wrote about the gold open interest surging ahead by 14,416 contracts on Monday and how that invited a (price) beat down. Although, when I wrote that, the beat down was in progress (on Tuesday). What I didn't know was the beat down reversed that entire OI increase, dropping OI by 14,189 contracts.

One of the larger OI increases immediately followed by one of the larger reductions:

What happened with silver? The Tuesday smack down did drive a few longs out of the May silver contract ... just 22 contracts. But a near offsetting number (18) opened June contracts as you can see below. This may seem like small potatoes but between the tail of the May contract and the upcoming June contract,  7-1/2 million oz will need delivered shortly. The June contract is an inactive month and typically all of those dudes hang around for delivery.

The shorts on the May contract continue to not deliver metal ... zero delivery notices last night. Eight days left to deliver.

# The firm’s market access controls failed to prevent five erroneous orders routed to exchanges and alternative trading systems:

* On January 30, 2019, a firm trader on the Program Trading Agency Desk routed to the market an order to purchase 50,000 shares of an equity security. 
   * The trader intended to enter a limit price of $268.50, but mistakenly input $286.50. 
   * The firm received executions with prices over 5% higher than the last execution in the market prior to entry of this order. 
   * The firm submitted clearly erroneous filings and approximately half of the 50,000-share order (executions above $276.57) were busted. 
* On July 26, 2019, a client entered a market order to sell 86,500 equity shares instead of the intended limit order. 
   * A trader accepted the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The last share price at the time of order entry was $27.23. 
   * The firm received executions at prices down to $22.25, representing an approximately 18% drop. 
* On December 19, 2019, instead of entering a limit-on-close order, a firm trader on the Equity Finance Trading Desk erroneously entered a limit order to buy 230,000 shares of an equity security at $154.17. 
   * The firm routed the order to the market and received executions with prices up to $154.17, which was approximately 3% higher than the prior execution price at order entry of $149.52. 
   * The firm filed a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $154.01 were busted. 
* On March 26, 2020, a client entered a pairs order in the firm’s system. 
   * While a firm algorithm was handling the order, a control paused the order for manual review. 
   * After the review and the resumption of the order, the algorithm handling the order did not refresh the market data to account for the pause. 
   * In less than one minute, the system routed to various execution venues over 80,000 immediate-or-cancel orders, which the execution venues canceled back unfilled because they were priced away from the prevailing market. 
* On April 22, 2021, a client entered a market order to buy 4,765 equity shares but intended to buy 50 shares at a limit price of $4,765. 
   * The Electronic Client Solutions Desk received the order and routed it to the market. 
   * The firm received executions with prices up to $5,077.30, which was approximately 6% higher than the last traded price of $4,799.99. 
   * The firm submitted a clearly erroneous submission and all trades above $4,903.50 were busted. 

# The firm’s erroneous order and duplicative order controls were not reasonably designed:  

* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied fixed single order quantity limits ranging from 100,000 to 9,999,999 shares depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client involved in each order. 
   * The firm also applied static single order notional value limits ranging from $25,000,000 to $500,000,000 depending on the specific desk, trader, and/or client. Each of these single order quantity and single order notional value limits applied static limits regardless of security and thus failed to consider the individual characteristics of the security. 
   * The firm further applied average daily volume limits ranging from 25 to 50 percent based on the specific desk, trader, and/or client.
   *  With the exception of one desk’s single order quantity control, the firm’s single order quantity, single order notional value, and average daily value thresholds were too large to be effective, and the firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set them at such levels.
* Moreover, many of the above referenced size controls triggered “soft blocks” when applicable thresholds were reached. 
   * In contrast to a “hard block,” which generally prevents an order from being submitted by automatically rejecting it, a soft block pauses an order until the block is overridden or the order is cancelled back or modified. 
      * For most of the relevant period, however, the firm’s written supervisory procedures did not address how to handle, document, and review soft block overrides. 
      * Accordingly, the firm’s controls that relied on soft blocks did not prevent the entry of certain erroneous orders. 
      * By January 2021, the firm implemented changes to its supervisory requirements relating to soft blocks that included tracking and reviews of soft block overrides and adding compliance trainings and updates to its written supervisory procedures on the handling of soft blocks.
* For each of the orders described above, the firm’s trading desks applied single order limit price controls based on fixed percentages away from the National Best Bid and Offer, ranging from three to 15 percent depending on the desk, trader, and/or client involved. 
   * Like the firm’s size controls, certain limit price thresholds were set too high to be effective. 
   * In particular, the limit price controls generally exceeded the numerical guidelines for clearly erroneous transactions. 
   * The firm failed to provide any documented rationale for why it set its limit price thresholds at levels greater than the definition of a clearly erroneous transaction. 
      * Additionally, for the same reasons previously noted above, the firm’s supervisory system for soft blocks was deficient for most of the relevant period. 
      * In October 2020, the firm began introducing a price control that applied different thresholds to differently priced securities.  
* Furthermore, the firm did not have a reasonable duplicative order control. 
   * The firm did apply a risk control that checked orders with the same symbol, side, and quantity. 
   * This control triggered a hard block if more than 50,000 order messages with the same symbol, side, and quantity were sent within two seconds. 
   * However, the 50,000-order threshold, which was applied separately to each of the firm’s connections to external venues, was too high to be effective. 
   * The firm provided no documented rationale supporting why such a high threshold was reasonable. 

As of July 2022, the firm had implemented additional controls to prevent the entry of orders that—based on price and/or size of the order relative to the market—could potentially lead to unintended market impact.

Perhaps even more than Wexner, the Crowns are a testament to how the worlds of organized crime and corporate power have mixed over the years to produce elites who are truly untouchable. With a long-standing dominant role in the American military-industrial complex as well as other facets of the corporate world, the Crowns have a history of doing what’s necessary – whether legal or illegal – to get what they want to advance their political agendas and grow their own power. Even presidents and the Pentagon have been unable to successfully challenge them. As this article will show, the Crowns – perhaps more than any other group – are a critical part of the story of how Jame Dimon became the king of Wall Street.

Plus, JP Morgan has now nearly restocked its gold vault after dumping 33.5 tonne of gold $200 ago. That's the ""smart"" money! After a huge 3 day surge followed by a one day drop, the total gold contract open interest has settled into normalcy. The June contract is now a few days into the roll period as that contract's OI is falling and the roll month of August is increasing.

Typically there is a total OI increase during this portion of the roll, so today's total OI increase of 3,166 is normal compared to the average of 3,570. You can see the OI cycle below where the solid black line is the arithmetic average:

Let's talk silver!

The upcoming June contract's OI has increased to 981, or about 4.9 million oz, and is much higher than recent months. This is an inactive month and typically, these contracts stay open and take delivery. You can see that in the flat bold black average line which stays mostly flat during the run up to first notice day. That's in sharp contrast to the active months where OI is plunging toward FND. Real men buy inactive months ... apparently.

That 4.9 million oz is 18% of registered vault totals. If you think of it relative to the registered vault total, suddenly the June contract OI is almost twice the average inactive month. See the plot below.

Perhaps that's why some silver is arriving at the vaults lately.

Speaking of the silver vaults, after increasing for each of the last 3 days, 220,000 oz departed the vaults:

JP Morgan,"We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan?","We encourage and laugh with Microstrategy now, but won't there be a time when Microstrategy owns a significant percentage of Bitcoin supply and we'll have grown to hate them like we dislike JP Morgan? Microstrategy has an insane plan. It's wildly complex and super intricate. After much analysis I have concluded the following:

When BTC goes up, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC goes down, MS buys Bitcoin

When BTC crabs, MS buys Bitcoin

When Michael Saylor is sued, MS buys Bitcoin

It may be a bit hard to follow but I can dumb in down for you: MS buys Bitcoin.

I even made a joke of it here, and I think we generally view MS as on 'our side' but MS currently owns around 140,000 BTC which is about 0.72% of circulating supply. It's doesn't sound like *that* much but it's pretty close to close to an entire 1%. In fact, it's almost certain that they will own more than 1% of the total supply at the end of all this. And that percentage is deceiving because we don't know how many BTC is permanently burned, but it's likely quite a lot, so the actual percentage they'll own will be even greater. Chainalysis estimates that up to 20% of the Bitcoin already issued may be permanently lost, which means they own more like 0.9% of what's left.

To put their buys into perspective, in just 2 years since March 2021, they managed to purchase 0.25% of circulating supply. Estimates have put the final Bitcoin to be mined in 2140. Of course, most of us won't be alive, but if MS continues at current rates, they'll have another 2.5% of supply in just 10 years. This is a hard estimate as their are many factors to this but it's fair enough I think. Imagine how much they'll earn in 30 years alone, when we would have all grown old(er).

I don't think we'll look at then the way we do now.",0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,0.8881,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12fz6jg/we_encourage_and_laugh_with_microstrategy_now_but/,04/09/2023,02:35:43,OneThatNoseOne,324,

Federal regulators accused Bank of America on Tuesday of harming customers by double-dipping on fees, withholding credit card rewards and opening fake accounts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay more than $100 million to customers and $90 million in penalties. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay $60 million in fines.

Some of the allegations are reminiscent of the Wells Fargo scandal last decade that involved opening millions of bank accounts without customer authorization. “Bank of America wrongfully withheld credit card rewards, double-dipped on fees, and opened accounts without consent,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. “These practices are illegal and undermine customer trust.

The losses are weighing on BofA's net interest margin, an important gauge of performance. BofA's stock has dropped 15% this year, making it the worst performer of any of its large rivals.  
  
Although BoA insists that these losses are merely on paper and it doesn't intend to sell these bonds, the reality remains that the bank's potential to generate income from its customer deposits could be significantly limited.  
  
The losses are the result of a strategy the bank implemented three years ago, when it pumped $670 billion in pandemic-era deposit inflows into debt markets.  
  
The value of BofA's securities portfolio has plunged as yields have risen and bond prices have fallen. At that time, bond prices were high and yields were low. However, as yields have risen and bond prices have dropped, BoA has seen a staggering loss in the value of its portfolio. This loss is double the figure reported by its biggest peers, reflecting the bank's aggressive strategy to favor bonds over cash.

NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BofA) (BAC.N) said on Monday it had begun a dialogue with the Federal Reserve to understand differing results between the central bank's stress test and the company's own under the Dodd-Frank Act.

Unlike rivals, BofA, the second-biggest U.S. lender, has not made any announcements about its dividend or share repurchases since the stress test results were published last week.

The Fed's annual test showed major lenders, including BofA, have enough capital to weather a severe economic slump, paving the way for them to issue share buybacks and dividends. to end the second quarter and the
But BofA wants to understand the differences in a category called ""other comprehensive income"" during a nine-quarter period measured in the test, it said in a statement.

The Federal Reserve declined to comment.

BofA's own analysis implied a worse result than the Fed's test last week, Piper Sandler analyst R. Scott Siefers said in a note published on Monday.

Bank of America,Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months.,"Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months. I’m 34. I’ve had a BofA account since I was 16. In the last year, BofA closed all of my accounts (business and personal) because of an accusation of money laundering. The funds in question were all my salary from working as a traveling engineer in construction. They locked all of my accounts, sent every credit card balance to collections, and confiscated all of the money I had in my accounts. It took two weeks for income verification and ID verifications to process to unlock my accounts but all collections accounts were closed and remained in collections. 

When questioned, BofA representatives stated that they called me for a week several months prior to locking my accounts. They never called me because they “didn’t have my number” and they never sent me a letter because “they didn’t have my email or address.” But, I visited a local BofA branch when I needed money, I travel for work, and they email me statements every month…

It’s one year later and they have decided to call me every 3-6 months to confirm my employment details. They deleted most of my online details so I can’t see what I owe them. I have to call them to get a balance which means they could lie to me. I really want these buttheads out of my life!

Bank of America,Bank of America or Suncoast,"Bank of America or Suncoast #**urgent and need some quick advice**

Very uneducated on banking, only know stuff on superficial level. My mom has been trying to move all of my savings into bank of america for months. She says she wants me to stop using my debit card on suncoast and only focus on my credit card with bank of america. She helped me get my first credit card there and now she wants me to relocate my cash into bank of america so she can monitor the growth or whatever. She also says that it's more secure, that when someone had control of her card, that b-of-a immediately canceled it when it said it was suspicious. 

I've kept my bank of america account just to grow my credit score, but I'm not really okay with moving all my money into it. Suncoast is apparently better in every way but I don't have a good frame of reference on the pros and cons. 

So what are the pros and cons of using bank of america vs suncoast credit? Which one overall is better?",0.8939,0.8939,0.8939,0.8939,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/1543sf9/bank_of_america_or_suncoast/,07/20/2023,00:03:50,FEAR_LORD_DUCK,69,Americas

I've created a spreadsheet that contains 10 years of data from Bank of America's balance sheet and income statements, historical data for several popular multiples like P/B and P/TBV, and there are a couple valuation models such as Aswath Damodarans newest FCFE model for banks.

&#x200B;

As for the company, BAC seems to be a very popular holding in this community, and it's the largest bank that I've publicly valued. They just released second quarter earnings and they seem to be pretty upbeat, but after taking a deeper look at the company I was left with mixed feelings. My overall thoughts are that Bank of America is a sound bank, but I feel that it deserves to trade around its current market price. So, to further explain this I'm going to try my best to provide a detailed write up on what I found and why I think BAC is fairly valued. Fair warning though the write up is about 1,900 words, so if you just like looking at the numbers then feel free to skip this and go straight to the sheet!

&#x200B;

Out of the five banks I've looked at, BAC has the most held to maturity securities (making up 81.22% of their total securities), and their total debt securities (HTM and HFS securities) have been decreasing since 2021. Over the same time period they've managed to increase their interest bearing deposits, but non-interest bearing deposits have been leaving at a faster rate resulting in their total deposits decreasing 187.24b (-9.07%). Their risk-weighted assets and common shareholders' equity also haven't changed much over the past five years, but they have done a good job at increasing their net income (5 year CAGR of 9.38%). On a similar note, their ROE has been pretty good (TTM ROE of 12.92% / 5 year average of 12.15%), and they've consistently been increasing their tier 1 capital (Q2 tier 1 capital ratio of 15.22%).

&#x200B;

But just a little while ago they got hit with a fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for ""systematically double-dipping on fees imposed on customers with insufficient funds in their account, withholding reward bonuses explicitly promised to credit card customers, and misappropriating sensitive personal information to open accounts."" With this fine they will reportedly have to pay over $100m to customers, $90m in penalties to the CFPB, and $60m in penalties to the OCC, resulting in a total of roughly $250 million ([read the full article here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/bank-of-america-for-illegally-charging-junk-fees-withholding-credit-card-rewards-opening-fake-accounts/)). And while that fine may seem like a slap on the wrist, if regulators crack down on their ability to produce income from fees and commissions, which is their biggest source of non-interest income and accounted for \~30% of their total revenue this quarter, then their margins might begin to decline rather drastically. Now how much of their income from fees and commissions is actually attributable to these underhanded schemes is unknown, but it wouldn't surprise me if we start to see this line item decrease in the future.

&#x200B;

So, from my perspective it seems like BAC has been struggling to grow, and despite some of their impressive metrics it doesn't seem like they're going to have an underdog story. Based on their performance they seem like they're already as big as they're going to get, which in my mind paints a rather bleak outlook for the company. That said, I've copied Aswath Damodarans latest method of valuing a bank ([check out his video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdhTVs36z4c&t=1895s&ab_channel=AswathDamodaran)) and included 4 of these models on my spreadsheet. For this sheet I've decided to use the data from their latest quarterly statement so the models are based on TTM and Q2 numbers, all of this can be found on the sheet though, and my inputs and results for the models are as follows:

||Average Estimate|Low Estimate|Moderate Est.|High Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Risk-Adjusted Asset Growth (Years 1-5)|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|3.00%|
|Perpetual Asset Growth|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|2.00%|
|Target T1 Capital Ratio|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|
|Target ROE|9.14%|12.50%|13.14%|13.14%|
|Cost of Equity|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|
|Estimated Value|$26.13|$33.95|$36.53|$36.87|

As of writing this BAC is trading at $31.66, and if you'd like to see all of the numbers check out the Est. pages on the spreadsheet.

&#x200B;

The Average Estimate is based on their historical figures. So, the 1.58% risk-adjusted asset growth rate is based on their 10 year CAGR of risk-adjusted assets, the target ROE of 9.14% is based on their average ROE over the past ten years, and the cost of equity is based on Aswath Damodarans calculations where he tried to find the average for the 25 largest US banks. So, I've stuck with his figure of 11.67% for consistency. Now I would normally use the average T1 capital ratio (13.17% in this case), but due to recent events and BAC increasing their T1 ratio to 15.22% in Q2 I'm going to say they'll try to maintain a ratio around 15%. Also, this does assume that their ROE will drop to levels last seen in 2020 (falling -29.28% TTM to year five), but I feel these assumptions are fitting given the recent turmoil and penalties they're facing. This all results in T1 capital increasing from Q2 to year five (14.41b / 6.59%), a 5.65% increase in common shareholders' equity, and based on their TTM net income of 28.24b it will have decrease 3.62b / 12.83% in steady state. And when you plug all these numbers in you end up with a price per share of $26.13 which is 17.46% lower than the market price.

&#x200B;

For the Low Est. it uses the same assumptions as the Average, except I assume that ROE will take a lesser hit and return to the 5 year average of 12.5% (-2.65% from 2022 to year 5). This still results in the same increase in T1 capital and common shareholders' equity due to the T1 capital ratio staying at 15% and thanks to assets growing from 1.44t in Q2 to 1.58t in steady state (up 141.59b / 9.86%). But since ROE will remain relatively high, their net income ends up increasing 4.48b / 15.87% to 32.72b in steady state. And these inputs result in a price per share of $32.29 which is 7.21% higher than the market price.

&#x200B;

Then the Moderate Est. uses the same growth rate for risk-weighted assets and T1 capital, but it has them staying on the higher end of their recent ROE. This is assuming the recent fines don't disturb their margins, but their median ROE over the past five years has been 13.14%, and their TTM ROE is 12.92% so it would only need to increase 1.67% over five years to arrive at the median value. This results in net income increasing from 28.24b (TTM) to 35.39b in steady state (up 7.15b / 25.31%), and a price per share of $36.53 which is 15.33% higher than the current price.

&#x200B;

And lastly, the High Est. uses the same 5 year median ROE as the Moderate one, but it assume that risk-adjusted assets will grow at 3% a year until year five and at that point it will grow at 2% in perpetuity. This causes risk-adjusted assets to grow to 1.697t (up 261.96b / 18.25%) and net income to increase to 37.59b (up 9.35b / 33.1%) in steady state. To do this and maintain a T1 capital ratio of 15% they would need to grow their T1 capital by 31.15b (14.25%) from Q2 to year five, and it results in common shareholders' equity increasing 12.21% over that time. All of this results in a price per share of $36.87 which is 16.42% higher than the current market price.

&#x200B;

Now this last estimate tells the high growth story that I assume most Bank of America investors would like to see, and it’s stories like this that inspired me to use multiple models when valuing a bank. I know I’m not perfect and I feel as though all of the assumptions I’m making are at least somewhat reasonable, so I try to approach the valuation from multiple perspectives to give me a better understanding of what others could be seeing. In the same vein, this also allows me to make more assumptions about the future so there’s less room for error, and in this case we can see that even if they have a great future the price I arrive at is still pretty close to the current price.

On another note, I feel as though the Moderate Est. is the most realistic one out of these four, but if you disagree or would like to make different assumptions all together then feel free to do so and let me know! Also, if you take the average of my four estimates you get a price per share of $33.37 which is 5.37% higher than the current market price, so regardless of which one of these estimates is the most realistic I think BAC is currently trading around its fair value. To back this up, I've looked at their average and median P/TBV, P/B, P/E, and P/S over the past ten years and my findings were as follows:

|Multiples|Current|Average|Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/TBV|1.45|1.42|1.39|
|P/B|1.03|1.00|0.98|
|P/E|9.94|20.59|16.67|
|P/S|2.70|2.33|2.33|

Out of these four multiples you can see that all of them, except for the P/E, are around their average and median values. Now I know the P/E is the most popular multiple and it's regarded as a relatively important one even for banks, but from what I've seen that doesn't seem to be the case for banks, and I think it will deserve a post of its own one day. I digress though, after calculating their historical multiples I looked at the inputs for these multiples for the current year and multiplied them by their average/median value to get a price per share. This price per share reflects what their market price would be based on their average/median multiple and their last reported value (EOY 2022 for consistency). For example, BAC has an average P/B of 0.9966 (which is rounded up to 1.00 on the chart), their book value of common shareholders' equity (per share) in 2022 was 30.61, so if they were to trade at their average P/B then the market price would be $30.51 (0.9966 \* 30.61).  And this leads me to the last chart that shows the market prices based on the aforementioned calculation:

|Multiples Continued|2022 Values|Price Based on Average|Price Based on Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tangible Book Value|21.83|$31.03|$30.29|
|Book Value|30.61|$30.51|$30.02|
|Earnings Per Share|3.19|$65.57|$53.08|
|Sales Per Share|11.75|$27.34|$27.38|
|Average||$38.61|$35.19|
|% Change to Average||21.92%|11.12%|

Again, as of writing this BAC closed the day at $31.66 which is higher than all of the average and median values except for their P/E, and in this case I would say that the P/E is definitely an outlier. But even if you include it in the data the average values of the price columns are within 22% of the current market price. So, from a multiples perspective I would not consider BAC a buy either, and between this, their less than astonishing financials, and my somewhat bleak outlook on their cashflows I will not be starting a position in Bank of America. Now, this isn't meant to be a hit piece on BAC by any means and I'm simply trying to explain my findings. So, I highly encourage people to take a look at the spreadsheet, and as stated earlier it contains ten years of data from their balance sheet and income statements, as well as price action data, multiples, and valuation models. On that note though, I hope you all enjoyed my first write up and I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts on Bank of America!",0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1557v1o/bank_of_america_financial_statements_and_analysis/,07/21/2023,05:08:48,Benis_Benis_Benis,23,Americas

Never received my card, I called in to ask about it and customer service said all was good. Around 6/20 I received a letter asking me to call within 30 days of receipt of the letter or my account would be closed for potential fraud. I called immediately and was informed that the phone number I had listed wasn’t working, sure enough it was an old number. I apologized and fixed things with the number and verified that now, all was good. The CS rep said “yep! Everything looks good now. You should have your card in 7-10 business days!” Hung up the phone and went about my day. Until 7/3 when I received a letter inviting me to apply with a fake card in it. I called in customer service - just to be safe and they informed me that my account had been closed for failure to call when I received the letter. Spent around an hour on the phone with CS and the previous rep had not notated correctly and left out the notation stating that the phone number was updated. The system still had the correct phone number but because the CS rep didn’t notate it right they said there was nothing I could do unless I wanted to reapply. I laughed and said “hell no!” And got approved for the Wells Fargo active cash while I was on the phone. 
Fast forward to today and I just received a letter saying my new card application from 7/5 was approved!?!?!? Even though I was EXPLICIT that I did not want to reapply and I wanted nothing to do with them after the nightmare customer service.

On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.

A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech. On the economic front this week is lighter than the past few. We get a speech today from ECB president Lagarde, retail sales on Tuesday, and then housing data and initial jobless claims later in the week. Some expected moves for notable earnings this week. Check back in to see updated moves and prices:

Bank of America,Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do?,"Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do? Hello r/Debt,

I owned a restaurant with my biological family and after the pandemic came through the restaurant closed its doors. I had several credit cards at the time that I had to stop paying because I was unemployed. I made my last payment on my credit cards in October of 2021.

I’m now employed. I live and work in one state, but have kept my address back in another state at the house where my adoptive parents reside. I recently received mail at their residence from a debt collector regarding a credit card I had at Bank of America with an outstanding balance of less than $6,500.00. The mail came from a debt collector “trying to collect a debt I owe to Bank of America, N.A.” In order to dispute the debt the mail states I need to write to the debt collection company before June 29th, 2023. Unfortunately that date had passed by the time my parents showed me the letter.

I then received another piece of mail (at their residency) from a bankruptcy firm stating that Bank of America has filed a lawsuit against me. In the mail there was a web address where I could look up information on the lawsuit - with the status “SUMMONS ISSUED TO ATTY BY AG (MY NAME)”. And a few days later someone showed up at my parents residence to serve papers to me, but since I do not live there the papers were not served.

What I’m trying to figure out is how to approach this. I’m unsure if Bank of America sold my debt - but everything I’ve read online states that Bank of America does not sell debt. I did my free annual credit report and was unable to see a creditor - I was only able to see that the account was charged off a while back. 

If I could pay a smaller portion of what I owe I would like to do that - as I still have other financial stresses to worry about. If I have to pay in full over time, then I can make that happen as well. What I want to avoid is going to court in another state or having my wages garnished. I’d rather tackle this head on. But where do I start? I do not want to file bankruptcy as I am paying off another credit card and eventually would like to settle with the others as well. 

Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

They've taken away many services from their actual branches, and I've had to change my safety deposit box four times because they keep closing their banks in my area. I've lost count of how many times I've accidentally called them Capital One instead of Bank of America. Despite this, I have a very good checking account that meets all my needs, and they've been trying to get me to switch to a different account for years. However, I refuse to do so because I'll lose all the other benefits that I currently have. They're now charging me for checks and two checkbooks, which comes to a total of $27. If I change my account, those fees will be waived, but I don't want to lose everything else I have with them. It's important to note that Bank of America was founded as a Mafia bank, but I'm hesitant to switch because I have too many things tied up with them.

Bank of America,Is Bank of America always this incompetent?,"Is Bank of America always this incompetent? I have just had the most aggravating experience trying to close out a savings account in which my minor daughter & myself were the payable on death beneficiaries! My mom passed away last July and left behind a personal savings account that she used to set aside money for my daughter. My parents had done estate planning in 2018 & had a trust created so that probate would be avoided and my brother & I could easily close out their estates when they died. Their house and their joint accounts are part of this trust however my moms own personal savings account that she was using to save money for her granddaughter was NOT put in to the trust, specifically so that when she died, I could take out that money and give it to my daughter.

Long story short, BofA in Nevada where my parents live told my dad that all I had to do to get the $ from the savings account was to go to any branch here in CA where I live with the death certificate and my ID and they would give me the money and close the account. So I went to a local branch with those documents and they refused to close the account because they said I needed a letter, I forget what it's called. A week or so later I get said letter in the mail, fill it out and go back to the bank and this time I even brought my daughter and her ID. Was told I would get a check from the state in the mail. Thought that was weird but the gal helping me didn't seem familiar with POD accounts so I didn't question it. I ended up making 2-3 more trips to the bank because after each visit they would send me a letter with more forms to be signed by my dad who trustee of the family trust. Then they wanted my daughters birth certificate which I provided. The last letter they sent, they sent forms that my dad had to sign and have notarized. So he did that and sent them to me and I waited 10 months to try to deal with this again. 

Yesterday I made my final trip to BofA where right away the young man helping me told
Me that the savings account isn't part of the trust and that they don't need the documents I brought in. Manager got involved, confirmed he was right, called the estate unit to verify and first the estate unit said yes the account can be closed and paid out to me then they backtracked and said they can't do anything with the account because they need more documents from the trust! Manager had to tell them several times that the account is NOT IN THE TRUST so they shouldn't be asking me for trust paperwork when I am not even trustee and anyway an hour and 15 after I got there, I walked out with a cashiers check for the balance in the account! 

I cannot believe it took 2 bank branches and 5 attempts to close this account! Multiple employees accessed the account and yet only 1 was able to see that it wasn't part of a trust and needed to be handled like any other POD account! 

I closed my own BofA account 25 years ago and never regretted it. And I will never open an account with them again after this.",0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/14tv030/is_bank_of_america_always_this_incompetent/,07/08/2023,10:36:06,Admirable_Height3696,17,Americas

Bank of America $BAC will pay $250 million in fines and restitution for engaging in unethical practices, including double-charging fees, withholding promised credit card perks, and opening accounts without customer authorization.

Banks can still engage in illegal and harmful practices, even after being punished for them in the past. This is not the first time that Bank of America has been fined for its practices. In 2010, the bank paid $13 Billion to settle charges that it had misled investors about the quality of its mortgage loans.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said that Bank of America violated a number of laws beginning in 2012:

1) The bank double-charged customers' fees for overdrafts, even when they had enough money in their accounts to cover the transactions.

2) Bank of America withheld promised credit card perks, such as cash rewards and bonus points.

3) The bank opened accounts without customer authorization, often by employees who were under pressure to meet sales goals.

Bank of America,Bank of America Scam,"Bank of America Scam I narrowly avoided falling for a very convincing scam. 

 I got a text message from Bank of America about fraudulent charges.  I logged onto the BoA website and there were 2 attempts at purchasing a Sam's Club membership.  As I was going through the screens on the BoA website, I got a robocall.  I answered and there was a recording saying ""this is BoA fraud department.  If we get disconnected, please call back at xxx-xxx-xxxx (I don't remember the number and I didn't write it down.)


A woman with a heavy indian accent comes on the line and says she has to verify my account and can she send me a code. (Red flag, but OK.)  A few seconds later, I get a text from BoA with a code and the warning that ""we will never call or text you asking for this code"" so I definitely wasn't giving out the code and I just hung up.  


This was really convincing because there ARE 2 fraudulent charges on my account and every text I received from BoA was real. I had previous texts from them about other transactions and logins. When I logged into my account, I used my bookmarked page and my password manager saved password popped up (which wouldn't have happened if it was a fake site without the right domain.) 


I don't know if the timing of the call was coincidental or not---I don't see how they could have known I was on the real BoA website looking into the fraudulent charges but since my phone rang as I was literally hitting ""submit"" on the fraud page, it made perfect sense to me that they would be calling asking for more details so they can investigate.  


Thank you to this subreddit!!  I knew immediately that I shouldn't give out the code so I saved myself a huge headache of being locked out of my credit card account.


EDIT:  I already contacted BoA to notify them, then they cancelled my card and they're sending me a new one.

The first time Coinbase send me this notifaction in March this year, I opened a ticket. The response was that I should not worry and that there would be more information to come later this year. I waited, now with the final mail, they went further and announced the deadline for close. I again opened a ticket just to be get a ChatGPT like answer that was referring to a completly different topic (how to verify that an e-mail is actually from coinbase using their domain model?!) than my request to get some background why my account was being close and whether there would be any actions to mitigate this from happening.  


While I would still like to remain a Coinbase customer, I must admit that I am very disappointed by how Coinbase treats long-term customers, while at the same time the CEO assumes the very same harmful behaviour with Bank of America.

Bank of America,U.S. focus on green energy transition is working and silver continues to be the biggest beneficiary - Bank of America,"U.S. focus on green energy transition is working and silver continues to be the biggest beneficiary - Bank of America According to the research, prices could remain well-supported for the next ten years, with Bank of America seeing  [silver](https://www.kitco.com/silver-price-today-usa/) as the precious metal with the most significant supply deficit as the U.S. establishes itself as the leader in green technology and the global center for electric vehicles.

The analysts noted that [silver](https://www.kitco.com/silver-price-today-usa/) plays a crucial role in solar power and is a critical component in photovoltaic solar panels. Silver is also needed in electric vehicles and the general electrification of the economy. Bank of America said [silver](https://www.kitco.com/silver-price-today-usa/)'s supply deficit is expected to reach 125% by 2030.

I went to a branch and when I did I was informed that Bank of America has permanently banned me from bank accounts there because I didn’t physically go to a branch in time - a timer that ran out while I was in the branch. 

Beware.

I went to a branch on Monday morning and was approved for a ML account, already had an existing credit card, but was banned because of the checking and savings account ""timer,"" which I found to be insulting because I was in the branch on *Monday morning* and the other accounts were approved.

Bank of America,[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer,"[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer About two weeks ago I opened a checking with BofA (because it's required for the Preferred Rewards program), opened an account with Merrill (to transfer in enough money to qualify for Platinum Honors), and then opened a CC with BofA (specifically, Premium Rewards Elite).

The initial deposit to the Checking went through fine, as did my transfer to Merrill (though that had to be done over the phone).  Now I'm trying to setup an external account for ongoing transfers into the BofA Checking and I'm striking out.

It looks like I have two methods to do it.

* The first is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""Wire/ACH"", and then ""Add Account/Recipient"".  When I do this, I fill out the form, it sends me a text, then I get an error ""Your account has not been added. We were unable to verify your account."", though curiously about 5 minutes later I get an email saying it was setup.

* The second method showed up after my CC was activated and is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""BofA Credit Cards"" and then ""Manage Accounts from Other Banks"".  When I fill this out it says ""Coming Soon. You'll have the ability to add accounts from other banks to make payments. Please check back again soon.""

I've gotten these errors with accounts at two different banks but I had no issue setting up both of them with the instant verification at Merrill which is supposedly identical.

I called their support for web & app this morning and as soon as they heard ""trying to pay credit card"" they transferred me to someone over there.  The CC people told me I could make a payment over the phone each month which is ridiculous.  They did check with someone technical who suggested using Chrome or Firefox instead of Edge, but that didn't help either.  I suspect making an appointment at a branch won't help either because I've had to do that twice already for different issues (in two weeks) and all they do is call the same toll-free number I was calling.

How do I get past this?  I'm not going to manually push money into BofA each month from an external account (which I've started the process of setting up this morning so that I can at the very least cover the current bill) and then make a manual payment from my Checking.  Auto Paying a CC via ACH from an external account is something that has been easy for 20+ years and somehow BofA has managed to make it impossible.

EDIT: Screenshots of the errors I'm getting https://imgur.com/a/CRR6nT7

My opinion is that office loan defaults are the elephant in the room for banks, which will cause ripple effects that may begin a stock market selloff. 

Either way office loans will either default or get moved to a bank special assets division (crappy loans), and either scenario will negatively affect a banks balance sheet, and should cause investors to sell, right?

I just don’t know what I’m missing here.

You all. no doubt, are familiar with the  with  the next available agent  who does not exist on the telephone and the suggestion that you use their convenient website instead.  Ever gone to the website?  Unless you want to immediately pay your bill, there is no way to communicate with them in a way that your communication will be in their records.  In our case, because the charge just appeared on the bill we recently received but is a week and a half old, there is literally no way to fit into their communication categories.  Their general information section claims that there is a message center.  If so, there is no way to find it.  They clearly don't want ordinary humans just fucking writing to them with something they might have to later explain not responding to.

Solution:  a letter written on paper, placed in an envelope, and stamped with proper postage.  Then, payment of the bill, less the disputed charge when due.  Copy of letter kept with note of date of mailing.

Amount causing all this trouble? $49.95.  Assholes!

The losses are weighing on BofA's net interest margin, an important gauge of performance. BofA's stock has dropped 15% this year, making it the worst performer of any of its large rivals.  
  
Although BoA insists that these losses are merely on paper and it doesn't intend to sell these bonds, the reality remains that the bank's potential to generate income from its customer deposits could be significantly limited.  
  
The losses are the result of a strategy the bank implemented three years ago, when it pumped $670 billion in pandemic-era deposit inflows into debt markets.  
  
The value of BofA's securities portfolio has plunged as yields have risen and bond prices have fallen. At that time, bond prices were high and yields were low. However, as yields have risen and bond prices have dropped, BoA has seen a staggering loss in the value of its portfolio. This loss is double the figure reported by its biggest peers, reflecting the bank's aggressive strategy to favor bonds over cash.

Seems like Apes already called bull on this. 🥴 Is the Fed gaslighting? 
NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BofA) (BAC.N) said on Monday it had begun a dialogue with the Federal Reserve to understand differing results between the central bank's stress test and the company's own under the Dodd-Frank Act.

Unlike rivals, BofA, the second-biggest U.S. lender, has not made any announcements about its dividend or share repurchases since the stress test results were published last week.

The Fed's annual test showed major lenders, including BofA, have enough capital to weather a severe economic slump, paving the way for them to issue share buybacks and dividends. to end the second quarter and the
But BofA wants to understand the differences in a category called ""other comprehensive income"" during a nine-quarter period measured in the test, it said in a statement.

The Federal Reserve declined to comment.

BofA's own analysis implied a worse result than the Fed's test last week, Piper Sandler analyst R. Scott Siefers said in a note published on Monday.

Bank of America,Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months.,"Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months. I’m 34. I’ve had a BofA account since I was 16. In the last year, BofA closed all of my accounts (business and personal) because of an accusation of money laundering. The funds in question were all my salary from working as a traveling engineer in construction. They locked all of my accounts, sent every credit card balance to collections, and confiscated all of the money I had in my accounts. It took two weeks for income verification and ID verifications to process to unlock my accounts but all collections accounts were closed and remained in collections. 

When questioned, BofA representatives stated that they called me for a week several months prior to locking my accounts. They never called me because they “didn’t have my number” and they never sent me a letter because “they didn’t have my email or address.” But, I visited a local BofA branch when I needed money, I travel for work, and they email me statements every month…

It’s one year later and they have decided to call me every 3-6 months to confirm my employment details. They deleted most of my online details so I can’t see what I owe them. I have to call them to get a balance which means they could lie to me. I really want these buttheads out of my life!

&#x200B;

I've created a spreadsheet that contains 10 years of data from Bank of America's balance sheet and income statements, historical data for several popular multiples like P/B and P/TBV, and there are a couple valuation models such as Aswath Damodarans newest FCFE model for banks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As for the company, BAC seems to be a very popular holding in this community, and it's the largest bank that I've publicly valued. They just released second quarter earnings and they seem to be pretty upbeat, but after taking a deeper look at the company I was left with mixed feelings. My overall thoughts are that Bank of America is a sound bank, but I feel that it deserves to trade around its current market price. So, to further explain this I'm going to try my best to provide a detailed write up on what I found and why I think BAC is fairly valued. Fair warning though the write up is about 1,900 words, so if you just like looking at the numbers then feel free to skip this and go straight to the sheet!

&#x200B;

Out of the five banks I've looked at, BAC has the most held to maturity securities (making up 81.22% of their total securities), and their total debt securities (HTM and HFS securities) have been decreasing since 2021. Over the same time period they've managed to increase their interest bearing deposits, but non-interest bearing deposits have been leaving at a faster rate resulting in their total deposits decreasing 187.24b (-9.07%). Their risk-weighted assets and common shareholders' equity also haven't changed much over the past five years, but they have done a good job at increasing their net income (5 year CAGR of 9.38%). On a similar note, their ROE has been pretty good (TTM ROE of 12.92% / 5 year average of 12.15%), and they've consistently been increasing their tier 1 capital (Q2 tier 1 capital ratio of 15.22%).

&#x200B;

But just a little while ago they got hit with a fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for ""systematically double-dipping on fees imposed on customers with insufficient funds in their account, withholding reward bonuses explicitly promised to credit card customers, and misappropriating sensitive personal information to open accounts."" With this fine they will reportedly have to pay over $100m to customers, $90m in penalties to the CFPB, and $60m in penalties to the OCC, resulting in a total of roughly $250 million ([read the full article here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/bank-of-america-for-illegally-charging-junk-fees-withholding-credit-card-rewards-opening-fake-accounts/)). And while that fine may seem like a slap on the wrist, if regulators crack down on their ability to produce income from fees and commissions, which is their biggest source of non-interest income and accounted for \~30% of their total revenue this quarter, then their margins might begin to decline rather drastically. Now how much of their income from fees and commissions is actually attributable to these underhanded schemes is unknown, but it wouldn't surprise me if we start to see this line item decrease in the future.

&#x200B;

So, from my perspective it seems like BAC has been struggling to grow, and despite some of their impressive metrics it doesn't seem like they're going to have an underdog story. Based on their performance they seem like they're already as big as they're going to get, which in my mind paints a rather bleak outlook for the company. That said, I've copied Aswath Damodarans latest method of valuing a bank ([check out his video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdhTVs36z4c&t=1895s&ab_channel=AswathDamodaran)) and included 4 of these models on my spreadsheet. For this sheet I've decided to use the data from their latest quarterly statement so the models are based on TTM and Q2 numbers, all of this can be found on the sheet though, and my inputs and results for the models are as follows:

||Average Estimate|Low Estimate|Moderate Est.|High Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Risk-Adjusted Asset Growth (Years 1-5)|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|3.00%|
|Perpetual Asset Growth|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|2.00%|
|Target T1 Capital Ratio|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|
|Target ROE|9.14%|12.50%|13.14%|13.14%|
|Cost of Equity|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|
|Estimated Value|$26.13|$33.95|$36.53|$36.87|

As of writing this BAC is trading at $31.66, and if you'd like to see all of the numbers check out the Est. pages on the spreadsheet.

&#x200B;

The Average Estimate is based on their historical figures. So, the 1.58% risk-adjusted asset growth rate is based on their 10 year CAGR of risk-adjusted assets, the target ROE of 9.14% is based on their average ROE over the past ten years, and the cost of equity is based on Aswath Damodarans calculations where he tried to find the average for the 25 largest US banks. So, I've stuck with his figure of 11.67% for consistency. Now I would normally use the average T1 capital ratio (13.17% in this case), but due to recent events and BAC increasing their T1 ratio to 15.22% in Q2 I'm going to say they'll try to maintain a ratio around 15%. Also, this does assume that their ROE will drop to levels last seen in 2020 (falling -29.28% TTM to year five), but I feel these assumptions are fitting given the recent turmoil and penalties they're facing. This all results in T1 capital increasing from Q2 to year five (14.41b / 6.59%), a 5.65% increase in common shareholders' equity, and based on their TTM net income of 28.24b it will have decrease 3.62b / 12.83% in steady state. And when you plug all these numbers in you end up with a price per share of $26.13 which is 17.46% lower than the market price.

&#x200B;

For the Low Est. it uses the same assumptions as the Average, except I assume that ROE will take a lesser hit and return to the 5 year average of 12.5% (-2.65% from 2022 to year 5). This still results in the same increase in T1 capital and common shareholders' equity due to the T1 capital ratio staying at 15% and thanks to assets growing from 1.44t in Q2 to 1.58t in steady state (up 141.59b / 9.86%). But since ROE will remain relatively high, their net income ends up increasing 4.48b / 15.87% to 32.72b in steady state. And these inputs result in a price per share of $32.29 which is 7.21% higher than the market price.

&#x200B;

Then the Moderate Est. uses the same growth rate for risk-weighted assets and T1 capital, but it has them staying on the higher end of their recent ROE. This is assuming the recent fines don't disturb their margins, but their median ROE over the past five years has been 13.14%, and their TTM ROE is 12.92% so it would only need to increase 1.67% over five years to arrive at the median value. This results in net income increasing from 28.24b (TTM) to 35.39b in steady state (up 7.15b / 25.31%), and a price per share of $36.53 which is 15.33% higher than the current price.

&#x200B;

And lastly, the High Est. uses the same 5 year median ROE as the Moderate one, but it assume that risk-adjusted assets will grow at 3% a year until year five and at that point it will grow at 2% in perpetuity. This causes risk-adjusted assets to grow to 1.697t (up 261.96b / 18.25%) and net income to increase to 37.59b (up 9.35b / 33.1%) in steady state. To do this and maintain a T1 capital ratio of 15% they would need to grow their T1 capital by 31.15b (14.25%) from Q2 to year five, and it results in common shareholders' equity increasing 12.21% over that time. All of this results in a price per share of $36.87 which is 16.42% higher than the current market price.

&#x200B;

Now this last estimate tells the high growth story that I assume most Bank of America investors would like to see, and it’s stories like this that inspired me to use multiple models when valuing a bank. I know I’m not perfect and I feel as though all of the assumptions I’m making are at least somewhat reasonable, so I try to approach the valuation from multiple perspectives to give me a better understanding of what others could be seeing. In the same vein, this also allows me to make more assumptions about the future so there’s less room for error, and in this case we can see that even if they have a great future the price I arrive at is still pretty close to the current price.

On another note, I feel as though the Moderate Est. is the most realistic one out of these four, but if you disagree or would like to make different assumptions all together then feel free to do so and let me know! Also, if you take the average of my four estimates you get a price per share of $33.37 which is 5.37% higher than the current market price, so regardless of which one of these estimates is the most realistic I think BAC is currently trading around its fair value. To back this up, I've looked at their average and median P/TBV, P/B, P/E, and P/S over the past ten years and my findings were as follows:

|Multiples|Current|Average|Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/TBV|1.45|1.42|1.39|
|P/B|1.03|1.00|0.98|
|P/E|9.94|20.59|16.67|
|P/S|2.70|2.33|2.33|

Out of these four multiples you can see that all of them, except for the P/E, are around their average and median values. Now I know the P/E is the most popular multiple and it's regarded as a relatively important one even for banks, but from what I've seen that doesn't seem to be the case for banks, and I think it will deserve a post of its own one day. I digress though, after calculating their historical multiples I looked at the inputs for these multiples for the current year and multiplied them by their average/median value to get a price per share. This price per share reflects what their market price would be based on their average/median multiple and their last reported value (EOY 2022 for consistency). For example, BAC has an average P/B of 0.9966 (which is rounded up to 1.00 on the chart), their book value of common shareholders' equity (per share) in 2022 was 30.61, so if they were to trade at their average P/B then the market price would be $30.51 (0.9966 \* 30.61).  And this leads me to the last chart that shows the market prices based on the aforementioned calculation:

|Multiples Continued|2022 Values|Price Based on Average|Price Based on Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tangible Book Value|21.83|$31.03|$30.29|
|Book Value|30.61|$30.51|$30.02|
|Earnings Per Share|3.19|$65.57|$53.08|
|Sales Per Share|11.75|$27.34|$27.38|
|Average||$38.61|$35.19|
|% Change to Average||21.92%|11.12%|

Again, as of writing this BAC closed the day at $31.66 which is higher than all of the average and median values except for their P/E, and in this case I would say that the P/E is definitely an outlier. But even if you include it in the data the average values of the price columns are within 22% of the current market price. So, from a multiples perspective I would not consider BAC a buy either, and between this, their less than astonishing financials, and my somewhat bleak outlook on their cashflows I will not be starting a position in Bank of America. Now, this isn't meant to be a hit piece on BAC by any means and I'm simply trying to explain my findings. So, I highly encourage people to take a look at the spreadsheet, and as stated earlier it contains ten years of data from their balance sheet and income statements, as well as price action data, multiples, and valuation models. On that note though, I hope you all enjoyed my first write up and I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts on Bank of America!",0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1557v1o/bank_of_america_financial_statements_and_analysis/,07/21/2023,05:08:48,Benis_Benis_Benis,23,Europe

Bank of America,Bank Of America Beware,"Bank Of America Beware I was approved for the BOA customized cash credit card 6/3. Never received my card, I called in to ask about it and customer service said all was good. Around 6/20 I received a letter asking me to call within 30 days of receipt of the letter or my account would be closed for potential fraud. I called immediately and was informed that the phone number I had listed wasn’t working, sure enough it was an old number. I apologized and fixed things with the number and verified that now, all was good. The CS rep said “yep! Everything looks good now. You should have your card in 7-10 business days!” Hung up the phone and went about my day. Until 7/3 when I received a letter inviting me to apply with a fake card in it. I called in customer service - just to be safe and they informed me that my account had been closed for failure to call when I received the letter. Spent around an hour on the phone with CS and the previous rep had not notated correctly and left out the notation stating that the phone number was updated. The system still had the correct phone number but because the CS rep didn’t notate it right they said there was nothing I could do unless I wanted to reapply. I laughed and said “hell no!” And got approved for the Wells Fargo active cash while I was on the phone. 
Fast forward to today and I just received a letter saying my new card application from 7/5 was approved!?!?!? Even though I was EXPLICIT that I did not want to reapply and I wanted nothing to do with them after the nightmare customer service.

Bank of America,Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do?,"Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do? Hello r/Debt,

I owned a restaurant with my biological family and after the pandemic came through the restaurant closed its doors. I had several credit cards at the time that I had to stop paying because I was unemployed. I made my last payment on my credit cards in October of 2021.

I’m now employed. I live and work in one state, but have kept my address back in another state at the house where my adoptive parents reside. I recently received mail at their residence from a debt collector regarding a credit card I had at Bank of America with an outstanding balance of less than $6,500.00. The mail came from a debt collector “trying to collect a debt I owe to Bank of America, N.A.” In order to dispute the debt the mail states I need to write to the debt collection company before June 29th, 2023. Unfortunately that date had passed by the time my parents showed me the letter.

I then received another piece of mail (at their residency) from a bankruptcy firm stating that Bank of America has filed a lawsuit against me. In the mail there was a web address where I could look up information on the lawsuit - with the status “SUMMONS ISSUED TO ATTY BY AG (MY NAME)”. And a few days later someone showed up at my parents residence to serve papers to me, but since I do not live there the papers were not served.

What I’m trying to figure out is how to approach this. I’m unsure if Bank of America sold my debt - but everything I’ve read online states that Bank of America does not sell debt. I did my free annual credit report and was unable to see a creditor - I was only able to see that the account was charged off a while back. 

If I could pay a smaller portion of what I owe I would like to do that - as I still have other financial stresses to worry about. If I have to pay in full over time, then I can make that happen as well. What I want to avoid is going to court in another state or having my wages garnished. I’d rather tackle this head on. But where do I start? I do not want to file bankruptcy as I am paying off another credit card and eventually would like to settle with the others as well. 

Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

Bank of America,Bank of America accused of opening fake accounts and charging illegal junk fees,"Bank of America accused of opening fake accounts and charging illegal junk fees As someone who has been a Bank of America customer for 43 years, I'm not surprised by their poor customer service. They've taken away many services from their actual branches, and I've had to change my safety deposit box four times because they keep closing their banks in my area. I've lost count of how many times I've accidentally called them Capital One instead of Bank of America. Despite this, I have a very good checking account that meets all my needs, and they've been trying to get me to switch to a different account for years. However, I refuse to do so because I'll lose all the other benefits that I currently have. They're now charging me for checks and two checkbooks, which comes to a total of $27. If I change my account, those fees will be waived, but I don't want to lose everything else I have with them. It's important to note that Bank of America was founded as a Mafia bank, but I'm hesitant to switch because I have too many things tied up with them.

Bank of America,Is Bank of America always this incompetent?,"Is Bank of America always this incompetent? I have just had the most aggravating experience trying to close out a savings account in which my minor daughter & myself were the payable on death beneficiaries! My mom passed away last July and left behind a personal savings account that she used to set aside money for my daughter. My parents had done estate planning in 2018 & had a trust created so that probate would be avoided and my brother & I could easily close out their estates when they died. Their house and their joint accounts are part of this trust however my moms own personal savings account that she was using to save money for her granddaughter was NOT put in to the trust, specifically so that when she died, I could take out that money and give it to my daughter.

Long story short, BofA in Nevada where my parents live told my dad that all I had to do to get the $ from the savings account was to go to any branch here in CA where I live with the death certificate and my ID and they would give me the money and close the account. So I went to a local branch with those documents and they refused to close the account because they said I needed a letter, I forget what it's called. A week or so later I get said letter in the mail, fill it out and go back to the bank and this time I even brought my daughter and her ID. Was told I would get a check from the state in the mail. Thought that was weird but the gal helping me didn't seem familiar with POD accounts so I didn't question it. I ended up making 2-3 more trips to the bank because after each visit they would send me a letter with more forms to be signed by my dad who trustee of the family trust. Then they wanted my daughters birth certificate which I provided. The last letter they sent, they sent forms that my dad had to sign and have notarized. So he did that and sent them to me and I waited 10 months to try to deal with this again. 

Yesterday I made my final trip to BofA where right away the young man helping me told
Me that the savings account isn't part of the trust and that they don't need the documents I brought in. Manager got involved, confirmed he was right, called the estate unit to verify and first the estate unit said yes the account can be closed and paid out to me then they backtracked and said they can't do anything with the account because they need more documents from the trust! Manager had to tell them several times that the account is NOT IN THE TRUST so they shouldn't be asking me for trust paperwork when I am not even trustee and anyway an hour and 15 after I got there, I walked out with a cashiers check for the balance in the account! 

I cannot believe it took 2 bank branches and 5 attempts to close this account! Multiple employees accessed the account and yet only 1 was able to see that it wasn't part of a trust and needed to be handled like any other POD account! 

I closed my own BofA account 25 years ago and never regretted it. And I will never open an account with them again after this.",0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/14tv030/is_bank_of_america_always_this_incompetent/,07/08/2023,10:36:06,Admirable_Height3696,17,Europe

Bank of America $BAC will pay $250 million in fines and restitution for engaging in unethical practices, including double-charging fees, withholding promised credit card perks, and opening accounts without customer authorization.

Banks can still engage in illegal and harmful practices, even after being punished for them in the past. This is not the first time that Bank of America has been fined for its practices. In 2010, the bank paid $13 Billion to settle charges that it had misled investors about the quality of its mortgage loans.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said that Bank of America violated a number of laws beginning in 2012:

1) The bank double-charged customers' fees for overdrafts, even when they had enough money in their accounts to cover the transactions.

2) Bank of America withheld promised credit card perks, such as cash rewards and bonus points.

3) The bank opened accounts without customer authorization, often by employees who were under pressure to meet sales goals.

Bank of America,Bank of America Scam,"Bank of America Scam I narrowly avoided falling for a very convincing scam. 

 I got a text message from Bank of America about fraudulent charges.  I logged onto the BoA website and there were 2 attempts at purchasing a Sam's Club membership.  As I was going through the screens on the BoA website, I got a robocall.  I answered and there was a recording saying ""this is BoA fraud department.  If we get disconnected, please call back at xxx-xxx-xxxx (I don't remember the number and I didn't write it down.)


A woman with a heavy indian accent comes on the line and says she has to verify my account and can she send me a code. (Red flag, but OK.)  A few seconds later, I get a text from BoA with a code and the warning that ""we will never call or text you asking for this code"" so I definitely wasn't giving out the code and I just hung up.  


This was really convincing because there ARE 2 fraudulent charges on my account and every text I received from BoA was real. I had previous texts from them about other transactions and logins. When I logged into my account, I used my bookmarked page and my password manager saved password popped up (which wouldn't have happened if it was a fake site without the right domain.) 


I don't know if the timing of the call was coincidental or not---I don't see how they could have known I was on the real BoA website looking into the fraudulent charges but since my phone rang as I was literally hitting ""submit"" on the fraud page, it made perfect sense to me that they would be calling asking for more details so they can investigate.  


Thank you to this subreddit!!  I knew immediately that I shouldn't give out the code so I saved myself a huge headache of being locked out of my credit card account.


EDIT:  I already contacted BoA to notify them, then they cancelled my card and they're sending me a new one.

Bank of America,[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer,"[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer About two weeks ago I opened a checking with BofA (because it's required for the Preferred Rewards program), opened an account with Merrill (to transfer in enough money to qualify for Platinum Honors), and then opened a CC with BofA (specifically, Premium Rewards Elite).

The initial deposit to the Checking went through fine, as did my transfer to Merrill (though that had to be done over the phone).  Now I'm trying to setup an external account for ongoing transfers into the BofA Checking and I'm striking out.

It looks like I have two methods to do it.

* The first is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""Wire/ACH"", and then ""Add Account/Recipient"".  When I do this, I fill out the form, it sends me a text, then I get an error ""Your account has not been added. We were unable to verify your account."", though curiously about 5 minutes later I get an email saying it was setup.

* The second method showed up after my CC was activated and is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""BofA Credit Cards"" and then ""Manage Accounts from Other Banks"".  When I fill this out it says ""Coming Soon. You'll have the ability to add accounts from other banks to make payments. Please check back again soon.""

I've gotten these errors with accounts at two different banks but I had no issue setting up both of them with the instant verification at Merrill which is supposedly identical.

I called their support for web & app this morning and as soon as they heard ""trying to pay credit card"" they transferred me to someone over there.  The CC people told me I could make a payment over the phone each month which is ridiculous.  They did check with someone technical who suggested using Chrome or Firefox instead of Edge, but that didn't help either.  I suspect making an appointment at a branch won't help either because I've had to do that twice already for different issues (in two weeks) and all they do is call the same toll-free number I was calling.

How do I get past this?  I'm not going to manually push money into BofA each month from an external account (which I've started the process of setting up this morning so that I can at the very least cover the current bill) and then make a manual payment from my Checking.  Auto Paying a CC via ACH from an external account is something that has been easy for 20+ years and somehow BofA has managed to make it impossible.

EDIT: Screenshots of the errors I'm getting https://imgur.com/a/CRR6nT7

Bank of America,"A recession and a credit crunch could result in 1 trillion of corporate deadbolts, Bank of America says","A recession and a credit crunch could result in 1 trillion of corporate deadbolts, Bank of America says Why does it seem like the market doesn’t really care about this information. 

My opinion is that office loan defaults are the elephant in the room for banks, which will cause ripple effects that may begin a stock market selloff. 

Either way office loans will either default or get moved to a bank special assets division (crappy loans), and either scenario will negatively affect a banks balance sheet, and should cause investors to sell, right?

I just don’t know what I’m missing here.

God help us when AI really takes over.  The human operation is bad enough and AI will perfect it.  We'd like to dispute a charge on our credit card which is a BOA card.  You all. no doubt, are familiar with the  with  the next available agent  who does not exist on the telephone and the suggestion that you use their convenient website instead.  Ever gone to the website?  Unless you want to immediately pay your bill, there is no way to communicate with them in a way that your communication will be in their records.  In our case, because the charge just appeared on the bill we recently received but is a week and a half old, there is literally no way to fit into their communication categories.  Their general information section claims that there is a message center.  If so, there is no way to find it.  They clearly don't want ordinary humans just fucking writing to them with something they might have to later explain not responding to.

Solution:  a letter written on paper, placed in an envelope, and stamped with proper postage.  Then, payment of the bill, less the disputed charge when due.  Copy of letter kept with note of date of mailing.

Amount causing all this trouble? $49.95.  Assholes!

Federal regulators accused Bank of America on Tuesday of harming customers by double-dipping on fees, withholding credit card rewards and opening fake accounts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay more than $100 million to customers and $90 million in penalties. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay $60 million in fines.

Some of the allegations are reminiscent of the Wells Fargo scandal last decade that involved opening millions of bank accounts without customer authorization. “Bank of America wrongfully withheld credit card rewards, double-dipped on fees, and opened accounts without consent,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. “These practices are illegal and undermine customer trust.

The losses are weighing on BofA's net interest margin, an important gauge of performance. BofA's stock has dropped 15% this year, making it the worst performer of any of its large rivals.  
  
Although BoA insists that these losses are merely on paper and it doesn't intend to sell these bonds, the reality remains that the bank's potential to generate income from its customer deposits could be significantly limited.  
  
The losses are the result of a strategy the bank implemented three years ago, when it pumped $670 billion in pandemic-era deposit inflows into debt markets.  
  
The value of BofA's securities portfolio has plunged as yields have risen and bond prices have fallen. At that time, bond prices were high and yields were low. However, as yields have risen and bond prices have dropped, BoA has seen a staggering loss in the value of its portfolio. This loss is double the figure reported by its biggest peers, reflecting the bank's aggressive strategy to favor bonds over cash.

NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BofA) (BAC.N) said on Monday it had begun a dialogue with the Federal Reserve to understand differing results between the central bank's stress test and the company's own under the Dodd-Frank Act.

Unlike rivals, BofA, the second-biggest U.S. lender, has not made any announcements about its dividend or share repurchases since the stress test results were published last week.

The Fed's annual test showed major lenders, including BofA, have enough capital to weather a severe economic slump, paving the way for them to issue share buybacks and dividends. to end the second quarter and the
But BofA wants to understand the differences in a category called ""other comprehensive income"" during a nine-quarter period measured in the test, it said in a statement.

The Federal Reserve declined to comment.

BofA's own analysis implied a worse result than the Fed's test last week, Piper Sandler analyst R. Scott Siefers said in a note published on Monday.

Bank of America,Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months.,"Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months. I’m 34. I’ve had a BofA account since I was 16. In the last year, BofA closed all of my accounts (business and personal) because of an accusation of money laundering. The funds in question were all my salary from working as a traveling engineer in construction. They locked all of my accounts, sent every credit card balance to collections, and confiscated all of the money I had in my accounts. It took two weeks for income verification and ID verifications to process to unlock my accounts but all collections accounts were closed and remained in collections. 

When questioned, BofA representatives stated that they called me for a week several months prior to locking my accounts. They never called me because they “didn’t have my number” and they never sent me a letter because “they didn’t have my email or address.” But, I visited a local BofA branch when I needed money, I travel for work, and they email me statements every month…

It’s one year later and they have decided to call me every 3-6 months to confirm my employment details. They deleted most of my online details so I can’t see what I owe them. I have to call them to get a balance which means they could lie to me. I really want these buttheads out of my life!

&#x200B;

I've created a spreadsheet that contains 10 years of data from Bank of America's balance sheet and income statements, historical data for several popular multiples like P/B and P/TBV, and there are a couple valuation models such as Aswath Damodarans newest FCFE model for banks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As for the company, BAC seems to be a very popular holding in this community, and it's the largest bank that I've publicly valued. They just released second quarter earnings and they seem to be pretty upbeat, but after taking a deeper look at the company I was left with mixed feelings. My overall thoughts are that Bank of America is a sound bank, but I feel that it deserves to trade around its current market price. So, to further explain this I'm going to try my best to provide a detailed write up on what I found and why I think BAC is fairly valued. Fair warning though the write up is about 1,900 words, so if you just like looking at the numbers then feel free to skip this and go straight to the sheet!

&#x200B;

Out of the five banks I've looked at, BAC has the most held to maturity securities (making up 81.22% of their total securities), and their total debt securities (HTM and HFS securities) have been decreasing since 2021. Over the same time period they've managed to increase their interest bearing deposits, but non-interest bearing deposits have been leaving at a faster rate resulting in their total deposits decreasing 187.24b (-9.07%). Their risk-weighted assets and common shareholders' equity also haven't changed much over the past five years, but they have done a good job at increasing their net income (5 year CAGR of 9.38%). On a similar note, their ROE has been pretty good (TTM ROE of 12.92% / 5 year average of 12.15%), and they've consistently been increasing their tier 1 capital (Q2 tier 1 capital ratio of 15.22%).

&#x200B;

But just a little while ago they got hit with a fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for ""systematically double-dipping on fees imposed on customers with insufficient funds in their account, withholding reward bonuses explicitly promised to credit card customers, and misappropriating sensitive personal information to open accounts."" With this fine they will reportedly have to pay over $100m to customers, $90m in penalties to the CFPB, and $60m in penalties to the OCC, resulting in a total of roughly $250 million ([read the full article here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/bank-of-america-for-illegally-charging-junk-fees-withholding-credit-card-rewards-opening-fake-accounts/)). And while that fine may seem like a slap on the wrist, if regulators crack down on their ability to produce income from fees and commissions, which is their biggest source of non-interest income and accounted for \~30% of their total revenue this quarter, then their margins might begin to decline rather drastically. Now how much of their income from fees and commissions is actually attributable to these underhanded schemes is unknown, but it wouldn't surprise me if we start to see this line item decrease in the future.

&#x200B;

So, from my perspective it seems like BAC has been struggling to grow, and despite some of their impressive metrics it doesn't seem like they're going to have an underdog story. Based on their performance they seem like they're already as big as they're going to get, which in my mind paints a rather bleak outlook for the company. That said, I've copied Aswath Damodarans latest method of valuing a bank ([check out his video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdhTVs36z4c&t=1895s&ab_channel=AswathDamodaran)) and included 4 of these models on my spreadsheet. For this sheet I've decided to use the data from their latest quarterly statement so the models are based on TTM and Q2 numbers, all of this can be found on the sheet though, and my inputs and results for the models are as follows:

||Average Estimate|Low Estimate|Moderate Est.|High Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Risk-Adjusted Asset Growth (Years 1-5)|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|3.00%|
|Perpetual Asset Growth|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|2.00%|
|Target T1 Capital Ratio|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|
|Target ROE|9.14%|12.50%|13.14%|13.14%|
|Cost of Equity|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|
|Estimated Value|$26.13|$33.95|$36.53|$36.87|

As of writing this BAC is trading at $31.66, and if you'd like to see all of the numbers check out the Est. pages on the spreadsheet.

&#x200B;

The Average Estimate is based on their historical figures. So, the 1.58% risk-adjusted asset growth rate is based on their 10 year CAGR of risk-adjusted assets, the target ROE of 9.14% is based on their average ROE over the past ten years, and the cost of equity is based on Aswath Damodarans calculations where he tried to find the average for the 25 largest US banks. So, I've stuck with his figure of 11.67% for consistency. Now I would normally use the average T1 capital ratio (13.17% in this case), but due to recent events and BAC increasing their T1 ratio to 15.22% in Q2 I'm going to say they'll try to maintain a ratio around 15%. Also, this does assume that their ROE will drop to levels last seen in 2020 (falling -29.28% TTM to year five), but I feel these assumptions are fitting given the recent turmoil and penalties they're facing. This all results in T1 capital increasing from Q2 to year five (14.41b / 6.59%), a 5.65% increase in common shareholders' equity, and based on their TTM net income of 28.24b it will have decrease 3.62b / 12.83% in steady state. And when you plug all these numbers in you end up with a price per share of $26.13 which is 17.46% lower than the market price.

&#x200B;

For the Low Est. it uses the same assumptions as the Average, except I assume that ROE will take a lesser hit and return to the 5 year average of 12.5% (-2.65% from 2022 to year 5). This still results in the same increase in T1 capital and common shareholders' equity due to the T1 capital ratio staying at 15% and thanks to assets growing from 1.44t in Q2 to 1.58t in steady state (up 141.59b / 9.86%). But since ROE will remain relatively high, their net income ends up increasing 4.48b / 15.87% to 32.72b in steady state. And these inputs result in a price per share of $32.29 which is 7.21% higher than the market price.

&#x200B;

Then the Moderate Est. uses the same growth rate for risk-weighted assets and T1 capital, but it has them staying on the higher end of their recent ROE. This is assuming the recent fines don't disturb their margins, but their median ROE over the past five years has been 13.14%, and their TTM ROE is 12.92% so it would only need to increase 1.67% over five years to arrive at the median value. This results in net income increasing from 28.24b (TTM) to 35.39b in steady state (up 7.15b / 25.31%), and a price per share of $36.53 which is 15.33% higher than the current price.

&#x200B;

And lastly, the High Est. uses the same 5 year median ROE as the Moderate one, but it assume that risk-adjusted assets will grow at 3% a year until year five and at that point it will grow at 2% in perpetuity. This causes risk-adjusted assets to grow to 1.697t (up 261.96b / 18.25%) and net income to increase to 37.59b (up 9.35b / 33.1%) in steady state. To do this and maintain a T1 capital ratio of 15% they would need to grow their T1 capital by 31.15b (14.25%) from Q2 to year five, and it results in common shareholders' equity increasing 12.21% over that time. All of this results in a price per share of $36.87 which is 16.42% higher than the current market price.

&#x200B;

Now this last estimate tells the high growth story that I assume most Bank of America investors would like to see, and it’s stories like this that inspired me to use multiple models when valuing a bank. I know I’m not perfect and I feel as though all of the assumptions I’m making are at least somewhat reasonable, so I try to approach the valuation from multiple perspectives to give me a better understanding of what others could be seeing. In the same vein, this also allows me to make more assumptions about the future so there’s less room for error, and in this case we can see that even if they have a great future the price I arrive at is still pretty close to the current price.

On another note, I feel as though the Moderate Est. is the most realistic one out of these four, but if you disagree or would like to make different assumptions all together then feel free to do so and let me know! Also, if you take the average of my four estimates you get a price per share of $33.37 which is 5.37% higher than the current market price, so regardless of which one of these estimates is the most realistic I think BAC is currently trading around its fair value. To back this up, I've looked at their average and median P/TBV, P/B, P/E, and P/S over the past ten years and my findings were as follows:

|Multiples|Current|Average|Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/TBV|1.45|1.42|1.39|
|P/B|1.03|1.00|0.98|
|P/E|9.94|20.59|16.67|
|P/S|2.70|2.33|2.33|

Out of these four multiples you can see that all of them, except for the P/E, are around their average and median values. Now I know the P/E is the most popular multiple and it's regarded as a relatively important one even for banks, but from what I've seen that doesn't seem to be the case for banks, and I think it will deserve a post of its own one day. I digress though, after calculating their historical multiples I looked at the inputs for these multiples for the current year and multiplied them by their average/median value to get a price per share. This price per share reflects what their market price would be based on their average/median multiple and their last reported value (EOY 2022 for consistency). For example, BAC has an average P/B of 0.9966 (which is rounded up to 1.00 on the chart), their book value of common shareholders' equity (per share) in 2022 was 30.61, so if they were to trade at their average P/B then the market price would be $30.51 (0.9966 \* 30.61).  And this leads me to the last chart that shows the market prices based on the aforementioned calculation:

|Multiples Continued|2022 Values|Price Based on Average|Price Based on Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tangible Book Value|21.83|$31.03|$30.29|
|Book Value|30.61|$30.51|$30.02|
|Earnings Per Share|3.19|$65.57|$53.08|
|Sales Per Share|11.75|$27.34|$27.38|
|Average||$38.61|$35.19|
|% Change to Average||21.92%|11.12%|

Again, as of writing this BAC closed the day at $31.66 which is higher than all of the average and median values except for their P/E, and in this case I would say that the P/E is definitely an outlier. But even if you include it in the data the average values of the price columns are within 22% of the current market price. So, from a multiples perspective I would not consider BAC a buy either, and between this, their less than astonishing financials, and my somewhat bleak outlook on their cashflows I will not be starting a position in Bank of America. Now, this isn't meant to be a hit piece on BAC by any means and I'm simply trying to explain my findings. So, I highly encourage people to take a look at the spreadsheet, and as stated earlier it contains ten years of data from their balance sheet and income statements, as well as price action data, multiples, and valuation models. On that note though, I hope you all enjoyed my first write up and I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts on Bank of America!",0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1557v1o/bank_of_america_financial_statements_and_analysis/,07/21/2023,05:08:48,Benis_Benis_Benis,23,Africa

I called immediately and was informed that the phone number I had listed wasn’t working, sure enough it was an old number. I apologized and fixed things with the number and verified that now, all was good. The CS rep said “yep! Everything looks good now. You should have your card in 7-10 business days!” Hung up the phone and went about my day. Until 7/3 when I received a letter inviting me to apply with a fake card in it. I called in customer service - just to be safe and they informed me that my account had been closed for failure to call when I received the letter. Spent around an hour on the phone with CS and the previous rep had not notated correctly and left out the notation stating that the phone number was updated. The system still had the correct phone number but because the CS rep didn’t notate it right they said there was nothing I could do unless I wanted to reapply. I laughed and said “hell no!” And got approved for the Wells Fargo active cash while I was on the phone.

Bank of America,Are there any other cards I should consider when I already have Bank of America Platinum Honors?,"Are there any other cards I should consider when I already have Bank of America Platinum Honors? As a Bank of America Platinum Honors preferred rewards member, I can get all of the following without leaving my bank or paying any fees:

* Customized Cash Rewards cards: 5.25% effective cash back on gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drug stores, and home improvement/furnishings. Only one category per card, but I can always get multiple cards to cover multiple categories or increase my category cap.
* Unlimited Cash Rewards card: 2.62% effective cash back on everything else not covered by one of the above.
* Travel Rewards card: no Foreign Transaction Fee and 2.62% effective cash back on everything, except I need to redeem the rewards for statement credits instead of getting direct cash back.

Is there really anything else worth considering for me? I see a lot of cards like the Wells Fargo Autograph and the Capital One SavorOne that look really nice, but 3% categories just don't look as good when compared to 2.62% on everything, and 5.25% on my most common categories.

Tomorrow we get a second round of big bank reports when we hear from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (Goldman is a day later) as well as a look into online brokerage with Schwab and Interactive Brokers. On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.

A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech. On the economic front this week is lighter than the past few. We get a speech today from ECB president Lagarde, retail sales on Tuesday, and then housing data and initial jobless claims later in the week. Some expected moves for notable earnings this week.

Bank of America,Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do?,"Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do? Hello r/Debt,

I owned a restaurant with my biological family and after the pandemic came through the restaurant closed its doors. I had several credit cards at the time that I had to stop paying because I was unemployed. I made my last payment on my credit cards in October of 2021.

I’m now employed. I live and work in one state, but have kept my address back in another state at the house where my adoptive parents reside. I recently received mail at their residence from a debt collector regarding a credit card I had at Bank of America with an outstanding balance of less than $6,500.00. The mail came from a debt collector “trying to collect a debt I owe to Bank of America, N.A.” In order to dispute the debt the mail states I need to write to the debt collection company before June 29th, 2023. Unfortunately that date had passed by the time my parents showed me the letter.

I then received another piece of mail (at their residency) from a bankruptcy firm stating that Bank of America has filed a lawsuit against me. In the mail there was a web address where I could look up information on the lawsuit - with the status “SUMMONS ISSUED TO ATTY BY AG (MY NAME)”. And a few days later someone showed up at my parents residence to serve papers to me, but since I do not live there the papers were not served.

What I’m trying to figure out is how to approach this. I’m unsure if Bank of America sold my debt - but everything I’ve read online states that Bank of America does not sell debt. I did my free annual credit report and was unable to see a creditor - I was only able to see that the account was charged off a while back. 

If I could pay a smaller portion of what I owe I would like to do that - as I still have other financial stresses to worry about. If I have to pay in full over time, then I can make that happen as well. What I want to avoid is going to court in another state or having my wages garnished. I’d rather tackle this head on. But where do I start? I do not want to file bankruptcy as I am paying off another credit card and eventually would like to settle with the others as well. 

Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

They've taken away many services from their actual branches, and I've had to change my safety deposit box four times because they keep closing their banks in my area. I've lost count of how many times I've accidentally called them Capital One instead of Bank of America. Despite this, I have a very good checking account that meets all my needs, and they've been trying to get me to switch to a different account for years. However, I refuse to do so because I'll lose all the other benefits that I currently have. They're now charging me for checks and two checkbooks, which comes to a total of $27. If I change my account, those fees will be waived, but I don't want to lose everything else I have with them. It's important to note that Bank of America was founded as a Mafia bank, but I'm hesitant to switch because I have too many things tied up with them.

My mom passed away last July and left behind a personal savings account that she used to set aside money for my daughter. My parents had done estate planning in 2018 & had a trust created so that probate would be avoided and my brother & I could easily close out their estates when they died. Their house and their joint accounts are part of this trust however my moms own personal savings account that she was using to save money for her granddaughter was NOT put in to the trust, specifically so that when she died, I could take out that money and give it to my daughter.

Long story short, BofA in Nevada where my parents live told my dad that all I had to do to get the $ from the savings account was to go to any branch here in CA where I live with the death certificate and my ID and they would give me the money and close the account. So I went to a local branch with those documents and they refused to close the account because they said I needed a letter, I forget what it's called. A week or so later I get said letter in the mail, fill it out and go back to the bank and this time I even brought my daughter and her ID. Was told I would get a check from the state in the mail. Thought that was weird but the gal helping me didn't seem familiar with POD accounts so I didn't question it. I ended up making 2-3 more trips to the bank because after each visit they would send me a letter with more forms to be signed by my dad who trustee of the family trust. Then they wanted my daughters birth certificate which I provided. The last letter they sent, they sent forms that my dad had to sign and have notarized. So he did that and sent them to me and I waited 10 months to try to deal with this again. 

Yesterday I made my final trip to BofA where right away the young man helping me told
Me that the savings account isn't part of the trust and that they don't need the documents I brought in. Manager got involved, confirmed he was right, called the estate unit to verify and first the estate unit said yes the account can be closed and paid out to me then they backtracked and said they can't do anything with the account because they need more documents from the trust! Manager had to tell them several times that the account is NOT IN THE TRUST so they shouldn't be asking me for trust paperwork when I am not even trustee and anyway an hour and 15 after I got there, I walked out with a cashiers check for the balance in the account! 

I cannot believe it took 2 bank branches and 5 attempts to close this account! Multiple employees accessed the account and yet only 1 was able to see that it wasn't part of a trust and needed to be handled like any other POD account! 

I closed my own BofA account 25 years ago and never regretted it. And I will never open an account with them again after this.",0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/14tv030/is_bank_of_america_always_this_incompetent/,07/08/2023,10:36:06,Admirable_Height3696,17,Africa
Bank of America,"Bank of America $BAC will pay $250 million in fines and restitution for engaging in unethical practices, including double-charging fees, withholding promised credit card perks, and opening accounts without customer authorization.","Bank of America $BAC will pay $250 million in fines and restitution for engaging in unethical practices, including double-charging fees, withholding promised credit card perks, and opening accounts without customer authorization. Bank of America $BAC will pay $250 million in fines and restitution for engaging in unethical practices, including double-charging fees, withholding promised credit card perks, and opening accounts without customer authorization.

Banks can still engage in illegal and harmful practices, even after being punished for them in the past. This is not the first time that Bank of America has been fined for its practices. In 2010, the bank paid $13 Billion to settle charges that it had misled investors about the quality of its mortgage loans.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said that Bank of America violated a number of laws beginning in 2012:

1) The bank double-charged customers' fees for overdrafts, even when they had enough money in their accounts to cover the transactions.

2) Bank of America withheld promised credit card perks, such as cash rewards and bonus points.

3) The bank opened accounts without customer authorization, often by employees who were under pressure to meet sales goals.

Bank of America,Bank of America Scam,"Bank of America Scam I narrowly avoided falling for a very convincing scam. 

 I got a text message from Bank of America about fraudulent charges.  I logged onto the BoA website and there were 2 attempts at purchasing a Sam's Club membership.  As I was going through the screens on the BoA website, I got a robocall.  I answered and there was a recording saying ""this is BoA fraud department.  If we get disconnected, please call back at xxx-xxx-xxxx (I don't remember the number and I didn't write it down.)


A woman with a heavy indian accent comes on the line and says she has to verify my account and can she send me a code. (Red flag, but OK.)  A few seconds later, I get a text from BoA with a code and the warning that ""we will never call or text you asking for this code"" so I definitely wasn't giving out the code and I just hung up.  


This was really convincing because there ARE 2 fraudulent charges on my account and every text I received from BoA was real. I had previous texts from them about other transactions and logins. When I logged into my account, I used my bookmarked page and my password manager saved password popped up (which wouldn't have happened if it was a fake site without the right domain.) 


I don't know if the timing of the call was coincidental or not---I don't see how they could have known I was on the real BoA website looking into the fraudulent charges but since my phone rang as I was literally hitting ""submit"" on the fraud page, it made perfect sense to me that they would be calling asking for more details so they can investigate.  


Thank you to this subreddit!!  I knew immediately that I shouldn't give out the code so I saved myself a huge headache of being locked out of my credit card account.


EDIT:  I already contacted BoA to notify them, then they cancelled my card and they're sending me a new one.

Yet I am one of the customers that received a mail in that my account will be closed in September, since it does not meet the ""upgraded standards"".  


The first time Coinbase send me this notifaction in March this year, I opened a ticket. The response was that I should not worry and that there would be more information to come later this year. I waited, now with the final mail, they went further and announced the deadline for close. I again opened a ticket just to be get a ChatGPT like answer that was referring to a completly different topic (how to verify that an e-mail is actually from coinbase using their domain model?!) than my request to get some background why my account was being close and whether there would be any actions to mitigate this from happening.  


While I would still like to remain a Coinbase customer, I must admit that I am very disappointed by how Coinbase treats long-term customers, while at the same time the CEO assumes the very same harmful behaviour with Bank of America.

Bank of America,[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer,"[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer About two weeks ago I opened a checking with BofA (because it's required for the Preferred Rewards program), opened an account with Merrill (to transfer in enough money to qualify for Platinum Honors), and then opened a CC with BofA (specifically, Premium Rewards Elite).

The initial deposit to the Checking went through fine, as did my transfer to Merrill (though that had to be done over the phone).  Now I'm trying to setup an external account for ongoing transfers into the BofA Checking and I'm striking out.

It looks like I have two methods to do it.

* The first is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""Wire/ACH"", and then ""Add Account/Recipient"".  When I do this, I fill out the form, it sends me a text, then I get an error ""Your account has not been added. We were unable to verify your account."", though curiously about 5 minutes later I get an email saying it was setup.

* The second method showed up after my CC was activated and is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""BofA Credit Cards"" and then ""Manage Accounts from Other Banks"".  When I fill this out it says ""Coming Soon. You'll have the ability to add accounts from other banks to make payments. Please check back again soon.""

I've gotten these errors with accounts at two different banks but I had no issue setting up both of them with the instant verification at Merrill which is supposedly identical.

I called their support for web & app this morning and as soon as they heard ""trying to pay credit card"" they transferred me to someone over there.  The CC people told me I could make a payment over the phone each month which is ridiculous.  They did check with someone technical who suggested using Chrome or Firefox instead of Edge, but that didn't help either.  I suspect making an appointment at a branch won't help either because I've had to do that twice already for different issues (in two weeks) and all they do is call the same toll-free number I was calling.

How do I get past this?  I'm not going to manually push money into BofA each month from an external account (which I've started the process of setting up this morning so that I can at the very least cover the current bill) and then make a manual payment from my Checking.  Auto Paying a CC via ACH from an external account is something that has been easy for 20+ years and somehow BofA has managed to make it impossible.

My opinion is that office loan defaults are the elephant in the room for banks, which will cause ripple effects that may begin a stock market selloff. 

Either way office loans will either default or get moved to a bank special assets division (crappy loans), and either scenario will negatively affect a banks balance sheet, and should cause investors to sell, right?

I just don’t know what I’m missing here.

You all. no doubt, are familiar with the  with  the next available agent  who does not exist on the telephone and the suggestion that you use their convenient website instead.  Ever gone to the website?  Unless you want to immediately pay your bill, there is no way to communicate with them in a way that your communication will be in their records.  In our case, because the charge just appeared on the bill we recently received but is a week and a half old, there is literally no way to fit into their communication categories.  Their general information section claims that there is a message center.  If so, there is no way to find it.  They clearly don't want ordinary humans just fucking writing to them with something they might have to later explain not responding to.

Solution:  a letter written on paper, placed in an envelope, and stamped with proper postage.  Then, payment of the bill, less the disputed charge when due.  Copy of letter kept with note of date of mailing.

Amount causing all this trouble? $49.95.  Assholes!

Federal regulators accused Bank of America on Tuesday of harming customers by double-dipping on fees, withholding credit card rewards and opening fake accounts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay more than $100 million to customers and $90 million in penalties. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay $60 million in fines.

Some of the allegations are reminiscent of the Wells Fargo scandal last decade that involved opening millions of bank accounts without customer authorization. “Bank of America wrongfully withheld credit card rewards, double-dipped on fees, and opened accounts without consent,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. “These practices are illegal and undermine customer trust.

The losses are weighing on BofA's net interest margin, an important gauge of performance. BofA's stock has dropped 15% this year, making it the worst performer of any of its large rivals.  
  
Although BoA insists that these losses are merely on paper and it doesn't intend to sell these bonds, the reality remains that the bank's potential to generate income from its customer deposits could be significantly limited.  
  
The losses are the result of a strategy the bank implemented three years ago, when it pumped $670 billion in pandemic-era deposit inflows into debt markets.  
  
The value of BofA's securities portfolio has plunged as yields have risen and bond prices have fallen. At that time, bond prices were high and yields were low. However, as yields have risen and bond prices have dropped, BoA has seen a staggering loss in the value of its portfolio. This loss is double the figure reported by its biggest peers, reflecting the bank's aggressive strategy to favor bonds over cash.

NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BofA) (BAC.N) said on Monday it had begun a dialogue with the Federal Reserve to understand differing results between the central bank's stress test and the company's own under the Dodd-Frank Act.

Unlike rivals, BofA, the second-biggest U.S. lender, has not made any announcements about its dividend or share repurchases since the stress test results were published last week.

The Fed's annual test showed major lenders, including BofA, have enough capital to weather a severe economic slump, paving the way for them to issue share buybacks and dividends. to end the second quarter and the
But BofA wants to understand the differences in a category called ""other comprehensive income"" during a nine-quarter period measured in the test, it said in a statement.

The Federal Reserve declined to comment.

BofA's own analysis implied a worse result than the Fed's test last week, Piper Sandler analyst R. Scott Siefers said in a note published on Monday.

Bank of America,Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months.,"Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months. I’m 34. I’ve had a BofA account since I was 16. In the last year, BofA closed all of my accounts (business and personal) because of an accusation of money laundering. The funds in question were all my salary from working as a traveling engineer in construction. They locked all of my accounts, sent every credit card balance to collections, and confiscated all of the money I had in my accounts. It took two weeks for income verification and ID verifications to process to unlock my accounts but all collections accounts were closed and remained in collections. 

When questioned, BofA representatives stated that they called me for a week several months prior to locking my accounts. They never called me because they “didn’t have my number” and they never sent me a letter because “they didn’t have my email or address.” But, I visited a local BofA branch when I needed money, I travel for work, and they email me statements every month…

It’s one year later and they have decided to call me every 3-6 months to confirm my employment details. They deleted most of my online details so I can’t see what I owe them. I have to call them to get a balance which means they could lie to me. I really want these buttheads out of my life!

Bank of America,Bank of America or Suncoast,"Bank of America or Suncoast #**urgent and need some quick advice**

Very uneducated on banking, only know stuff on superficial level. My mom has been trying to move all of my savings into bank of america for months. She says she wants me to stop using my debit card on suncoast and only focus on my credit card with bank of america. She helped me get my first credit card there and now she wants me to relocate my cash into bank of america so she can monitor the growth or whatever. She also says that it's more secure, that when someone had control of her card, that b-of-a immediately canceled it when it said it was suspicious. 

I've kept my bank of america account just to grow my credit score, but I'm not really okay with moving all my money into it. Suncoast is apparently better in every way but I don't have a good frame of reference on the pros and cons. 

So what are the pros and cons of using bank of america vs suncoast credit? Which one overall is better?",0.8939,0.8939,0.8939,0.8939,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/1543sf9/bank_of_america_or_suncoast/,07/20/2023,00:03:50,FEAR_LORD_DUCK,69,Asia

I've created a spreadsheet that contains 10 years of data from Bank of America's balance sheet and income statements, historical data for several popular multiples like P/B and P/TBV, and there are a couple valuation models such as Aswath Damodarans newest FCFE model for banks.

&#x200B;

As for the company, BAC seems to be a very popular holding in this community, and it's the largest bank that I've publicly valued. They just released second quarter earnings and they seem to be pretty upbeat, but after taking a deeper look at the company I was left with mixed feelings. My overall thoughts are that Bank of America is a sound bank, but I feel that it deserves to trade around its current market price. So, to further explain this I'm going to try my best to provide a detailed write up on what I found and why I think BAC is fairly valued. Fair warning though the write up is about 1,900 words, so if you just like looking at the numbers then feel free to skip this and go straight to the sheet!

&#x200B;

Out of the five banks I've looked at, BAC has the most held to maturity securities (making up 81.22% of their total securities), and their total debt securities (HTM and HFS securities) have been decreasing since 2021. Over the same time period they've managed to increase their interest bearing deposits, but non-interest bearing deposits have been leaving at a faster rate resulting in their total deposits decreasing 187.24b (-9.07%). Their risk-weighted assets and common shareholders' equity also haven't changed much over the past five years, but they have done a good job at increasing their net income (5 year CAGR of 9.38%). On a similar note, their ROE has been pretty good (TTM ROE of 12.92% / 5 year average of 12.15%), and they've consistently been increasing their tier 1 capital (Q2 tier 1 capital ratio of 15.22%).

&#x200B;

But just a little while ago they got hit with a fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for ""systematically double-dipping on fees imposed on customers with insufficient funds in their account, withholding reward bonuses explicitly promised to credit card customers, and misappropriating sensitive personal information to open accounts."" With this fine they will reportedly have to pay over $100m to customers, $90m in penalties to the CFPB, and $60m in penalties to the OCC, resulting in a total of roughly $250 million ([read the full article here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/bank-of-america-for-illegally-charging-junk-fees-withholding-credit-card-rewards-opening-fake-accounts/)). And while that fine may seem like a slap on the wrist, if regulators crack down on their ability to produce income from fees and commissions, which is their biggest source of non-interest income and accounted for \~30% of their total revenue this quarter, then their margins might begin to decline rather drastically. Now how much of their income from fees and commissions is actually attributable to these underhanded schemes is unknown, but it wouldn't surprise me if we start to see this line item decrease in the future.

&#x200B;

So, from my perspective it seems like BAC has been struggling to grow, and despite some of their impressive metrics it doesn't seem like they're going to have an underdog story. Based on their performance they seem like they're already as big as they're going to get, which in my mind paints a rather bleak outlook for the company. That said, I've copied Aswath Damodarans latest method of valuing a bank ([check out his video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdhTVs36z4c&t=1895s&ab_channel=AswathDamodaran)) and included 4 of these models on my spreadsheet. For this sheet I've decided to use the data from their latest quarterly statement so the models are based on TTM and Q2 numbers, all of this can be found on the sheet though, and my inputs and results for the models are as follows:

||Average Estimate|Low Estimate|Moderate Est.|High Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Risk-Adjusted Asset Growth (Years 1-5)|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|3.00%|
|Perpetual Asset Growth|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|2.00%|
|Target T1 Capital Ratio|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|
|Target ROE|9.14%|12.50%|13.14%|13.14%|
|Cost of Equity|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|
|Estimated Value|$26.13|$33.95|$36.53|$36.87|

As of writing this BAC is trading at $31.66, and if you'd like to see all of the numbers check out the Est. pages on the spreadsheet.

&#x200B;

The Average Estimate is based on their historical figures. So, the 1.58% risk-adjusted asset growth rate is based on their 10 year CAGR of risk-adjusted assets, the target ROE of 9.14% is based on their average ROE over the past ten years, and the cost of equity is based on Aswath Damodarans calculations where he tried to find the average for the 25 largest US banks. So, I've stuck with his figure of 11.67% for consistency. Now I would normally use the average T1 capital ratio (13.17% in this case), but due to recent events and BAC increasing their T1 ratio to 15.22% in Q2 I'm going to say they'll try to maintain a ratio around 15%. Also, this does assume that their ROE will drop to levels last seen in 2020 (falling -29.28% TTM to year five), but I feel these assumptions are fitting given the recent turmoil and penalties they're facing. This all results in T1 capital increasing from Q2 to year five (14.41b / 6.59%), a 5.65% increase in common shareholders' equity, and based on their TTM net income of 28.24b it will have decrease 3.62b / 12.83% in steady state. And when you plug all these numbers in you end up with a price per share of $26.13 which is 17.46% lower than the market price.

&#x200B;

For the Low Est. it uses the same assumptions as the Average, except I assume that ROE will take a lesser hit and return to the 5 year average of 12.5% (-2.65% from 2022 to year 5). This still results in the same increase in T1 capital and common shareholders' equity due to the T1 capital ratio staying at 15% and thanks to assets growing from 1.44t in Q2 to 1.58t in steady state (up 141.59b / 9.86%). But since ROE will remain relatively high, their net income ends up increasing 4.48b / 15.87% to 32.72b in steady state. And these inputs result in a price per share of $32.29 which is 7.21% higher than the market price.

&#x200B;

Then the Moderate Est. uses the same growth rate for risk-weighted assets and T1 capital, but it has them staying on the higher end of their recent ROE. This is assuming the recent fines don't disturb their margins, but their median ROE over the past five years has been 13.14%, and their TTM ROE is 12.92% so it would only need to increase 1.67% over five years to arrive at the median value. This results in net income increasing from 28.24b (TTM) to 35.39b in steady state (up 7.15b / 25.31%), and a price per share of $36.53 which is 15.33% higher than the current price.

&#x200B;

And lastly, the High Est. uses the same 5 year median ROE as the Moderate one, but it assume that risk-adjusted assets will grow at 3% a year until year five and at that point it will grow at 2% in perpetuity. This causes risk-adjusted assets to grow to 1.697t (up 261.96b / 18.25%) and net income to increase to 37.59b (up 9.35b / 33.1%) in steady state. To do this and maintain a T1 capital ratio of 15% they would need to grow their T1 capital by 31.15b (14.25%) from Q2 to year five, and it results in common shareholders' equity increasing 12.21% over that time. All of this results in a price per share of $36.87 which is 16.42% higher than the current market price.

&#x200B;

Now this last estimate tells the high growth story that I assume most Bank of America investors would like to see, and it’s stories like this that inspired me to use multiple models when valuing a bank. I know I’m not perfect and I feel as though all of the assumptions I’m making are at least somewhat reasonable, so I try to approach the valuation from multiple perspectives to give me a better understanding of what others could be seeing. In the same vein, this also allows me to make more assumptions about the future so there’s less room for error, and in this case we can see that even if they have a great future the price I arrive at is still pretty close to the current price.

On another note, I feel as though the Moderate Est. is the most realistic one out of these four, but if you disagree or would like to make different assumptions all together then feel free to do so and let me know! Also, if you take the average of my four estimates you get a price per share of $33.37 which is 5.37% higher than the current market price, so regardless of which one of these estimates is the most realistic I think BAC is currently trading around its fair value. To back this up, I've looked at their average and median P/TBV, P/B, P/E, and P/S over the past ten years and my findings were as follows:

|Multiples|Current|Average|Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/TBV|1.45|1.42|1.39|
|P/B|1.03|1.00|0.98|
|P/E|9.94|20.59|16.67|
|P/S|2.70|2.33|2.33|

Out of these four multiples you can see that all of them, except for the P/E, are around their average and median values. Now I know the P/E is the most popular multiple and it's regarded as a relatively important one even for banks, but from what I've seen that doesn't seem to be the case for banks, and I think it will deserve a post of its own one day. I digress though, after calculating their historical multiples I looked at the inputs for these multiples for the current year and multiplied them by their average/median value to get a price per share. This price per share reflects what their market price would be based on their average/median multiple and their last reported value (EOY 2022 for consistency). For example, BAC has an average P/B of 0.9966 (which is rounded up to 1.00 on the chart), their book value of common shareholders' equity (per share) in 2022 was 30.61, so if they were to trade at their average P/B then the market price would be $30.51 (0.9966 \* 30.61).  And this leads me to the last chart that shows the market prices based on the aforementioned calculation:

|Multiples Continued|2022 Values|Price Based on Average|Price Based on Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tangible Book Value|21.83|$31.03|$30.29|
|Book Value|30.61|$30.51|$30.02|
|Earnings Per Share|3.19|$65.57|$53.08|
|Sales Per Share|11.75|$27.34|$27.38|
|Average||$38.61|$35.19|
|% Change to Average||21.92%|11.12%|

Again, as of writing this BAC closed the day at $31.66 which is higher than all of the average and median values except for their P/E, and in this case I would say that the P/E is definitely an outlier. But even if you include it in the data the average values of the price columns are within 22% of the current market price. So, from a multiples perspective I would not consider BAC a buy either, and between this, their less than astonishing financials, and my somewhat bleak outlook on their cashflows I will not be starting a position in Bank of America. Now, this isn't meant to be a hit piece on BAC by any means and I'm simply trying to explain my findings. So, I highly encourage people to take a look at the spreadsheet, and as stated earlier it contains ten years of data from their balance sheet and income statements, as well as price action data, multiples, and valuation models. On that note though, I hope you all enjoyed my first write up and I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts on Bank of America!",0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1557v1o/bank_of_america_financial_statements_and_analysis/,07/21/2023,05:08:48,Benis_Benis_Benis,23,Asia

Never received my card, I called in to ask about it and customer service said all was good. Around 6/20 I received a letter asking me to call within 30 days of receipt of the letter or my account would be closed for potential fraud. I called immediately and was informed that the phone number I had listed wasn’t working, sure enough it was an old number. I apologized and fixed things with the number and verified that now, all was good. The CS rep said “yep! Everything looks good now. You should have your card in 7-10 business days!” Hung up the phone and went about my day. Until 7/3 when I received a letter inviting me to apply with a fake card in it. I called in customer service - just to be safe and they informed me that my account had been closed for failure to call when I received the letter. Spent around an hour on the phone with CS and the previous rep had not notated correctly and left out the notation stating that the phone number was updated. The system still had the correct phone number but because the CS rep didn’t notate it right they said there was nothing I could do unless I wanted to reapply. I laughed and said “hell no!” And got approved for the Wells Fargo active cash while I was on the phone. 
Fast forward to today and I just received a letter saying my new card application from 7/5 was approved!?!?!? Even though I was EXPLICIT that I did not want to reapply and I wanted nothing to do with them after the nightmare customer service.

On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.

A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech. On the economic front this week is lighter than the past few. We get a speech today from ECB president Lagarde, retail sales on Tuesday, and then housing data and initial jobless claims later in the week. Some expected moves for notable earnings this week. Check back in to see updated moves and prices:

Bank of America,Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do?,"Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do? Hello r/Debt,

I owned a restaurant with my biological family and after the pandemic came through the restaurant closed its doors. I had several credit cards at the time that I had to stop paying because I was unemployed. I made my last payment on my credit cards in October of 2021.

I’m now employed. I live and work in one state, but have kept my address back in another state at the house where my adoptive parents reside. I recently received mail at their residence from a debt collector regarding a credit card I had at Bank of America with an outstanding balance of less than $6,500.00. The mail came from a debt collector “trying to collect a debt I owe to Bank of America, N.A.” In order to dispute the debt the mail states I need to write to the debt collection company before June 29th, 2023. Unfortunately that date had passed by the time my parents showed me the letter.

I then received another piece of mail (at their residency) from a bankruptcy firm stating that Bank of America has filed a lawsuit against me. In the mail there was a web address where I could look up information on the lawsuit - with the status “SUMMONS ISSUED TO ATTY BY AG (MY NAME)”. And a few days later someone showed up at my parents residence to serve papers to me, but since I do not live there the papers were not served.

What I’m trying to figure out is how to approach this. I’m unsure if Bank of America sold my debt - but everything I’ve read online states that Bank of America does not sell debt. I did my free annual credit report and was unable to see a creditor - I was only able to see that the account was charged off a while back. 

If I could pay a smaller portion of what I owe I would like to do that - as I still have other financial stresses to worry about. If I have to pay in full over time, then I can make that happen as well. What I want to avoid is going to court in another state or having my wages garnished. I’d rather tackle this head on. But where do I start? I do not want to file bankruptcy as I am paying off another credit card and eventually would like to settle with the others as well. 

Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

They've taken away many services from their actual branches, and I've had to change my safety deposit box four times because they keep closing their banks in my area. I've lost count of how many times I've accidentally called them Capital One instead of Bank of America. Despite this, I have a very good checking account that meets all my needs, and they've been trying to get me to switch to a different account for years. However, I refuse to do so because I'll lose all the other benefits that I currently have. They're now charging me for checks and two checkbooks, which comes to a total of $27. If I change my account, those fees will be waived, but I don't want to lose everything else I have with them. It's important to note that Bank of America was founded as a Mafia bank, but I'm hesitant to switch because I have too many things tied up with them.

Bank of America,Is Bank of America always this incompetent?,"Is Bank of America always this incompetent? I have just had the most aggravating experience trying to close out a savings account in which my minor daughter & myself were the payable on death beneficiaries! My mom passed away last July and left behind a personal savings account that she used to set aside money for my daughter. My parents had done estate planning in 2018 & had a trust created so that probate would be avoided and my brother & I could easily close out their estates when they died. Their house and their joint accounts are part of this trust however my moms own personal savings account that she was using to save money for her granddaughter was NOT put in to the trust, specifically so that when she died, I could take out that money and give it to my daughter.

Long story short, BofA in Nevada where my parents live told my dad that all I had to do to get the $ from the savings account was to go to any branch here in CA where I live with the death certificate and my ID and they would give me the money and close the account. So I went to a local branch with those documents and they refused to close the account because they said I needed a letter, I forget what it's called. A week or so later I get said letter in the mail, fill it out and go back to the bank and this time I even brought my daughter and her ID. Was told I would get a check from the state in the mail. Thought that was weird but the gal helping me didn't seem familiar with POD accounts so I didn't question it. I ended up making 2-3 more trips to the bank because after each visit they would send me a letter with more forms to be signed by my dad who trustee of the family trust. Then they wanted my daughters birth certificate which I provided. The last letter they sent, they sent forms that my dad had to sign and have notarized. So he did that and sent them to me and I waited 10 months to try to deal with this again. 

Yesterday I made my final trip to BofA where right away the young man helping me told
Me that the savings account isn't part of the trust and that they don't need the documents I brought in. Manager got involved, confirmed he was right, called the estate unit to verify and first the estate unit said yes the account can be closed and paid out to me then they backtracked and said they can't do anything with the account because they need more documents from the trust! Manager had to tell them several times that the account is NOT IN THE TRUST so they shouldn't be asking me for trust paperwork when I am not even trustee and anyway an hour and 15 after I got there, I walked out with a cashiers check for the balance in the account! 

I cannot believe it took 2 bank branches and 5 attempts to close this account! Multiple employees accessed the account and yet only 1 was able to see that it wasn't part of a trust and needed to be handled like any other POD account! 

I closed my own BofA account 25 years ago and never regretted it. And I will never open an account with them again after this.",0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/14tv030/is_bank_of_america_always_this_incompetent/,07/08/2023,10:36:06,Admirable_Height3696,17,Asia

Bank of America $BAC will pay $250 million in fines and restitution for engaging in unethical practices, including double-charging fees, withholding promised credit card perks, and opening accounts without customer authorization.

Banks can still engage in illegal and harmful practices, even after being punished for them in the past. This is not the first time that Bank of America has been fined for its practices. In 2010, the bank paid $13 Billion to settle charges that it had misled investors about the quality of its mortgage loans.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said that Bank of America violated a number of laws beginning in 2012:

1) The bank double-charged customers' fees for overdrafts, even when they had enough money in their accounts to cover the transactions.

2) Bank of America withheld promised credit card perks, such as cash rewards and bonus points.

3) The bank opened accounts without customer authorization, often by employees who were under pressure to meet sales goals.

Bank of America,Bank of America Scam,"Bank of America Scam I narrowly avoided falling for a very convincing scam. 

 I got a text message from Bank of America about fraudulent charges.  I logged onto the BoA website and there were 2 attempts at purchasing a Sam's Club membership.  As I was going through the screens on the BoA website, I got a robocall.  I answered and there was a recording saying ""this is BoA fraud department.  If we get disconnected, please call back at xxx-xxx-xxxx (I don't remember the number and I didn't write it down.)


A woman with a heavy indian accent comes on the line and says she has to verify my account and can she send me a code. (Red flag, but OK.)  A few seconds later, I get a text from BoA with a code and the warning that ""we will never call or text you asking for this code"" so I definitely wasn't giving out the code and I just hung up.  


This was really convincing because there ARE 2 fraudulent charges on my account and every text I received from BoA was real. I had previous texts from them about other transactions and logins. When I logged into my account, I used my bookmarked page and my password manager saved password popped up (which wouldn't have happened if it was a fake site without the right domain.) 


I don't know if the timing of the call was coincidental or not---I don't see how they could have known I was on the real BoA website looking into the fraudulent charges but since my phone rang as I was literally hitting ""submit"" on the fraud page, it made perfect sense to me that they would be calling asking for more details so they can investigate.  


Thank you to this subreddit!!  I knew immediately that I shouldn't give out the code so I saved myself a huge headache of being locked out of my credit card account.


EDIT:  I already contacted BoA to notify them, then they cancelled my card and they're sending me a new one.

The first time Coinbase send me this notifaction in March this year, I opened a ticket. The response was that I should not worry and that there would be more information to come later this year. I waited, now with the final mail, they went further and announced the deadline for close. I again opened a ticket just to be get a ChatGPT like answer that was referring to a completly different topic (how to verify that an e-mail is actually from coinbase using their domain model?!) than my request to get some background why my account was being close and whether there would be any actions to mitigate this from happening.  


While I would still like to remain a Coinbase customer, I must admit that I am very disappointed by how Coinbase treats long-term customers, while at the same time the CEO assumes the very same harmful behaviour with Bank of America.

Bank of America,U.S. focus on green energy transition is working and silver continues to be the biggest beneficiary - Bank of America,"U.S. focus on green energy transition is working and silver continues to be the biggest beneficiary - Bank of America According to the research, prices could remain well-supported for the next ten years, with Bank of America seeing  [silver](https://www.kitco.com/silver-price-today-usa/) as the precious metal with the most significant supply deficit as the U.S. establishes itself as the leader in green technology and the global center for electric vehicles.

The analysts noted that [silver](https://www.kitco.com/silver-price-today-usa/) plays a crucial role in solar power and is a critical component in photovoltaic solar panels. Silver is also needed in electric vehicles and the general electrification of the economy. Bank of America said [silver](https://www.kitco.com/silver-price-today-usa/)'s supply deficit is expected to reach 125% by 2030.

I went to a branch and when I did I was informed that Bank of America has permanently banned me from bank accounts there because I didn’t physically go to a branch in time - a timer that ran out while I was in the branch. 

Beware.

EDIT: I was planning on opening a variety of accounts over time. All I applied for was checking and savings online. I went to a branch on Monday morning and was approved for a ML account, already had an existing credit card, but was banned because of the checking and savings account ""timer,"" which I found to be insulting because I was in the branch on *Monday morning* and the other accounts were approved. 

The IRAs were going to be opened later because I needed and employer plan to mature, I didn't submit an application for retirement. For those asking about the timer, this is the text of the email:

Bank of America,[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer,"[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer About two weeks ago I opened a checking with BofA (because it's required for the Preferred Rewards program), opened an account with Merrill (to transfer in enough money to qualify for Platinum Honors), and then opened a CC with BofA (specifically, Premium Rewards Elite).

The initial deposit to the Checking went through fine, as did my transfer to Merrill (though that had to be done over the phone).  Now I'm trying to setup an external account for ongoing transfers into the BofA Checking and I'm striking out.

It looks like I have two methods to do it.

* The first is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""Wire/ACH"", and then ""Add Account/Recipient"".  When I do this, I fill out the form, it sends me a text, then I get an error ""Your account has not been added. We were unable to verify your account."", though curiously about 5 minutes later I get an email saying it was setup.

* The second method showed up after my CC was activated and is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""BofA Credit Cards"" and then ""Manage Accounts from Other Banks"".  When I fill this out it says ""Coming Soon. You'll have the ability to add accounts from other banks to make payments. Please check back again soon.""

I've gotten these errors with accounts at two different banks but I had no issue setting up both of them with the instant verification at Merrill which is supposedly identical.

I called their support for web & app this morning and as soon as they heard ""trying to pay credit card"" they transferred me to someone over there.  The CC people told me I could make a payment over the phone each month which is ridiculous.  They did check with someone technical who suggested using Chrome or Firefox instead of Edge, but that didn't help either.  I suspect making an appointment at a branch won't help either because I've had to do that twice already for different issues (in two weeks) and all they do is call the same toll-free number I was calling.

How do I get past this?  I'm not going to manually push money into BofA each month from an external account (which I've started the process of setting up this morning so that I can at the very least cover the current bill) and then make a manual payment from my Checking.  Auto Paying a CC via ACH from an external account is something that has been easy for 20+ years and somehow BofA has managed to make it impossible.

EDIT: Screenshots of the errors I'm getting https://imgur.com/a/CRR6nT7

EDIT: I called in again and this rep found a 3rd screen for setting up an external account, specific to bill pay, that seems like it's letting me add my account.

My opinion is that office loan defaults are the elephant in the room for banks, which will cause ripple effects that may begin a stock market selloff. 

Either way office loans will either default or get moved to a bank special assets division (crappy loans), and either scenario will negatively affect a banks balance sheet, and should cause investors to sell, right?

I just don’t know what I’m missing here.

You all. no doubt, are familiar with the  with  the next available agent  who does not exist on the telephone and the suggestion that you use their convenient website instead.  Ever gone to the website?  Unless you want to immediately pay your bill, there is no way to communicate with them in a way that your communication will be in their records.  In our case, because the charge just appeared on the bill we recently received but is a week and a half old, there is literally no way to fit into their communication categories.  Their general information section claims that there is a message center.  If so, there is no way to find it.  They clearly don't want ordinary humans just fucking writing to them with something they might have to later explain not responding to.

Solution:  a letter written on paper, placed in an envelope, and stamped with proper postage.  Then, payment of the bill, less the disputed charge when due.  Copy of letter kept with note of date of mailing.

Amount causing all this trouble? $49.95.  Assholes!

The losses are weighing on BofA's net interest margin, an important gauge of performance. BofA's stock has dropped 15% this year, making it the worst performer of any of its large rivals.  
  
Although BoA insists that these losses are merely on paper and it doesn't intend to sell these bonds, the reality remains that the bank's potential to generate income from its customer deposits could be significantly limited.  
  
The losses are the result of a strategy the bank implemented three years ago, when it pumped $670 billion in pandemic-era deposit inflows into debt markets.  
  
The value of BofA's securities portfolio has plunged as yields have risen and bond prices have fallen. At that time, bond prices were high and yields were low. However, as yields have risen and bond prices have dropped, BoA has seen a staggering loss in the value of its portfolio. This loss is double the figure reported by its biggest peers, reflecting the bank's aggressive strategy to favor bonds over cash.

Seems like Apes already called bull on this. 🥴 Is the Fed gaslighting? 
NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BofA) (BAC.N) said on Monday it had begun a dialogue with the Federal Reserve to understand differing results between the central bank's stress test and the company's own under the Dodd-Frank Act.

Unlike rivals, BofA, the second-biggest U.S. lender, has not made any announcements about its dividend or share repurchases since the stress test results were published last week.

The Fed's annual test showed major lenders, including BofA, have enough capital to weather a severe economic slump, paving the way for them to issue share buybacks and dividends. to end the second quarter and the
But BofA wants to understand the differences in a category called ""other comprehensive income"" during a nine-quarter period measured in the test, it said in a statement.

The Federal Reserve declined to comment.

BofA's own analysis implied a worse result than the Fed's test last week, Piper Sandler analyst R. Scott Siefers said in a note published on Monday.

Bank of America,Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months.,"Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months. I’m 34. I’ve had a BofA account since I was 16. In the last year, BofA closed all of my accounts (business and personal) because of an accusation of money laundering. The funds in question were all my salary from working as a traveling engineer in construction. They locked all of my accounts, sent every credit card balance to collections, and confiscated all of the money I had in my accounts. It took two weeks for income verification and ID verifications to process to unlock my accounts but all collections accounts were closed and remained in collections. 

When questioned, BofA representatives stated that they called me for a week several months prior to locking my accounts. They never called me because they “didn’t have my number” and they never sent me a letter because “they didn’t have my email or address.” But, I visited a local BofA branch when I needed money, I travel for work, and they email me statements every month…

It’s one year later and they have decided to call me every 3-6 months to confirm my employment details. They deleted most of my online details so I can’t see what I owe them. I have to call them to get a balance which means they could lie to me. I really want these buttheads out of my life!

&#x200B;

I've created a spreadsheet that contains 10 years of data from Bank of America's balance sheet and income statements, historical data for several popular multiples like P/B and P/TBV, and there are a couple valuation models such as Aswath Damodarans newest FCFE model for banks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As for the company, BAC seems to be a very popular holding in this community, and it's the largest bank that I've publicly valued. They just released second quarter earnings and they seem to be pretty upbeat, but after taking a deeper look at the company I was left with mixed feelings. My overall thoughts are that Bank of America is a sound bank, but I feel that it deserves to trade around its current market price. So, to further explain this I'm going to try my best to provide a detailed write up on what I found and why I think BAC is fairly valued. Fair warning though the write up is about 1,900 words, so if you just like looking at the numbers then feel free to skip this and go straight to the sheet!

&#x200B;

Out of the five banks I've looked at, BAC has the most held to maturity securities (making up 81.22% of their total securities), and their total debt securities (HTM and HFS securities) have been decreasing since 2021. Over the same time period they've managed to increase their interest bearing deposits, but non-interest bearing deposits have been leaving at a faster rate resulting in their total deposits decreasing 187.24b (-9.07%). Their risk-weighted assets and common shareholders' equity also haven't changed much over the past five years, but they have done a good job at increasing their net income (5 year CAGR of 9.38%). On a similar note, their ROE has been pretty good (TTM ROE of 12.92% / 5 year average of 12.15%), and they've consistently been increasing their tier 1 capital (Q2 tier 1 capital ratio of 15.22%).

&#x200B;

But just a little while ago they got hit with a fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for ""systematically double-dipping on fees imposed on customers with insufficient funds in their account, withholding reward bonuses explicitly promised to credit card customers, and misappropriating sensitive personal information to open accounts."" With this fine they will reportedly have to pay over $100m to customers, $90m in penalties to the CFPB, and $60m in penalties to the OCC, resulting in a total of roughly $250 million ([read the full article here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/bank-of-america-for-illegally-charging-junk-fees-withholding-credit-card-rewards-opening-fake-accounts/)). And while that fine may seem like a slap on the wrist, if regulators crack down on their ability to produce income from fees and commissions, which is their biggest source of non-interest income and accounted for \~30% of their total revenue this quarter, then their margins might begin to decline rather drastically. Now how much of their income from fees and commissions is actually attributable to these underhanded schemes is unknown, but it wouldn't surprise me if we start to see this line item decrease in the future.

&#x200B;

So, from my perspective it seems like BAC has been struggling to grow, and despite some of their impressive metrics it doesn't seem like they're going to have an underdog story. Based on their performance they seem like they're already as big as they're going to get, which in my mind paints a rather bleak outlook for the company. That said, I've copied Aswath Damodarans latest method of valuing a bank ([check out his video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdhTVs36z4c&t=1895s&ab_channel=AswathDamodaran)) and included 4 of these models on my spreadsheet. For this sheet I've decided to use the data from their latest quarterly statement so the models are based on TTM and Q2 numbers, all of this can be found on the sheet though, and my inputs and results for the models are as follows:

||Average Estimate|Low Estimate|Moderate Est.|High Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Risk-Adjusted Asset Growth (Years 1-5)|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|3.00%|
|Perpetual Asset Growth|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|2.00%|
|Target T1 Capital Ratio|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|
|Target ROE|9.14%|12.50%|13.14%|13.14%|
|Cost of Equity|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|
|Estimated Value|$26.13|$33.95|$36.53|$36.87|

As of writing this BAC is trading at $31.66, and if you'd like to see all of the numbers check out the Est. pages on the spreadsheet.

&#x200B;

The Average Estimate is based on their historical figures. So, the 1.58% risk-adjusted asset growth rate is based on their 10 year CAGR of risk-adjusted assets, the target ROE of 9.14% is based on their average ROE over the past ten years, and the cost of equity is based on Aswath Damodarans calculations where he tried to find the average for the 25 largest US banks. So, I've stuck with his figure of 11.67% for consistency. Now I would normally use the average T1 capital ratio (13.17% in this case), but due to recent events and BAC increasing their T1 ratio to 15.22% in Q2 I'm going to say they'll try to maintain a ratio around 15%. Also, this does assume that their ROE will drop to levels last seen in 2020 (falling -29.28% TTM to year five), but I feel these assumptions are fitting given the recent turmoil and penalties they're facing. This all results in T1 capital increasing from Q2 to year five (14.41b / 6.59%), a 5.65% increase in common shareholders' equity, and based on their TTM net income of 28.24b it will have decrease 3.62b / 12.83% in steady state. And when you plug all these numbers in you end up with a price per share of $26.13 which is 17.46% lower than the market price.

&#x200B;

For the Low Est. it uses the same assumptions as the Average, except I assume that ROE will take a lesser hit and return to the 5 year average of 12.5% (-2.65% from 2022 to year 5). This still results in the same increase in T1 capital and common shareholders' equity due to the T1 capital ratio staying at 15% and thanks to assets growing from 1.44t in Q2 to 1.58t in steady state (up 141.59b / 9.86%). But since ROE will remain relatively high, their net income ends up increasing 4.48b / 15.87% to 32.72b in steady state. And these inputs result in a price per share of $32.29 which is 7.21% higher than the market price.

&#x200B;

Then the Moderate Est. uses the same growth rate for risk-weighted assets and T1 capital, but it has them staying on the higher end of their recent ROE. This is assuming the recent fines don't disturb their margins, but their median ROE over the past five years has been 13.14%, and their TTM ROE is 12.92% so it would only need to increase 1.67% over five years to arrive at the median value. This results in net income increasing from 28.24b (TTM) to 35.39b in steady state (up 7.15b / 25.31%), and a price per share of $36.53 which is 15.33% higher than the current price.

&#x200B;

And lastly, the High Est. uses the same 5 year median ROE as the Moderate one, but it assume that risk-adjusted assets will grow at 3% a year until year five and at that point it will grow at 2% in perpetuity. This causes risk-adjusted assets to grow to 1.697t (up 261.96b / 18.25%) and net income to increase to 37.59b (up 9.35b / 33.1%) in steady state. To do this and maintain a T1 capital ratio of 15% they would need to grow their T1 capital by 31.15b (14.25%) from Q2 to year five, and it results in common shareholders' equity increasing 12.21% over that time. All of this results in a price per share of $36.87 which is 16.42% higher than the current market price.

&#x200B;

Now this last estimate tells the high growth story that I assume most Bank of America investors would like to see, and it’s stories like this that inspired me to use multiple models when valuing a bank. I know I’m not perfect and I feel as though all of the assumptions I’m making are at least somewhat reasonable, so I try to approach the valuation from multiple perspectives to give me a better understanding of what others could be seeing. In the same vein, this also allows me to make more assumptions about the future so there’s less room for error, and in this case we can see that even if they have a great future the price I arrive at is still pretty close to the current price.

On another note, I feel as though the Moderate Est. is the most realistic one out of these four, but if you disagree or would like to make different assumptions all together then feel free to do so and let me know! Also, if you take the average of my four estimates you get a price per share of $33.37 which is 5.37% higher than the current market price, so regardless of which one of these estimates is the most realistic I think BAC is currently trading around its fair value. To back this up, I've looked at their average and median P/TBV, P/B, P/E, and P/S over the past ten years and my findings were as follows:

|Multiples|Current|Average|Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/TBV|1.45|1.42|1.39|
|P/B|1.03|1.00|0.98|
|P/E|9.94|20.59|16.67|
|P/S|2.70|2.33|2.33|

Out of these four multiples you can see that all of them, except for the P/E, are around their average and median values. Now I know the P/E is the most popular multiple and it's regarded as a relatively important one even for banks, but from what I've seen that doesn't seem to be the case for banks, and I think it will deserve a post of its own one day. I digress though, after calculating their historical multiples I looked at the inputs for these multiples for the current year and multiplied them by their average/median value to get a price per share. This price per share reflects what their market price would be based on their average/median multiple and their last reported value (EOY 2022 for consistency). For example, BAC has an average P/B of 0.9966 (which is rounded up to 1.00 on the chart), their book value of common shareholders' equity (per share) in 2022 was 30.61, so if they were to trade at their average P/B then the market price would be $30.51 (0.9966 \* 30.61).  And this leads me to the last chart that shows the market prices based on the aforementioned calculation:

|Multiples Continued|2022 Values|Price Based on Average|Price Based on Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tangible Book Value|21.83|$31.03|$30.29|
|Book Value|30.61|$30.51|$30.02|
|Earnings Per Share|3.19|$65.57|$53.08|
|Sales Per Share|11.75|$27.34|$27.38|
|Average||$38.61|$35.19|
|% Change to Average||21.92%|11.12%|

Again, as of writing this BAC closed the day at $31.66 which is higher than all of the average and median values except for their P/E, and in this case I would say that the P/E is definitely an outlier. But even if you include it in the data the average values of the price columns are within 22% of the current market price. So, from a multiples perspective I would not consider BAC a buy either, and between this, their less than astonishing financials, and my somewhat bleak outlook on their cashflows I will not be starting a position in Bank of America. Now, this isn't meant to be a hit piece on BAC by any means and I'm simply trying to explain my findings. So, I highly encourage people to take a look at the spreadsheet, and as stated earlier it contains ten years of data from their balance sheet and income statements, as well as price action data, multiples, and valuation models. On that note though, I hope you all enjoyed my first write up and I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts on Bank of America!",0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1557v1o/bank_of_america_financial_statements_and_analysis/,07/21/2023,05:08:48,Benis_Benis_Benis,23,Other

Bank of America,Bank Of America Beware,"Bank Of America Beware I was approved for the BOA customized cash credit card 6/3. Never received my card, I called in to ask about it and customer service said all was good. Around 6/20 I received a letter asking me to call within 30 days of receipt of the letter or my account would be closed for potential fraud. I called immediately and was informed that the phone number I had listed wasn’t working, sure enough it was an old number. I apologized and fixed things with the number and verified that now, all was good. The CS rep said “yep! Everything looks good now. You should have your card in 7-10 business days!” Hung up the phone and went about my day. Until 7/3 when I received a letter inviting me to apply with a fake card in it. I called in customer service - just to be safe and they informed me that my account had been closed for failure to call when I received the letter. Spent around an hour on the phone with CS and the previous rep had not notated correctly and left out the notation stating that the phone number was updated. The system still had the correct phone number but because the CS rep didn’t notate it right they said there was nothing I could do unless I wanted to reapply. I laughed and said “hell no!” And got approved for the Wells Fargo active cash while I was on the phone. 
Fast forward to today and I just received a letter saying my new card application from 7/5 was approved!?!?!? Even though I was EXPLICIT that I did not want to reapply and I wanted nothing to do with them after the nightmare customer service.

Bank of America,Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do?,"Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do? Hello r/Debt,

I owned a restaurant with my biological family and after the pandemic came through the restaurant closed its doors. I had several credit cards at the time that I had to stop paying because I was unemployed. I made my last payment on my credit cards in October of 2021.

I’m now employed. I live and work in one state, but have kept my address back in another state at the house where my adoptive parents reside. I recently received mail at their residence from a debt collector regarding a credit card I had at Bank of America with an outstanding balance of less than $6,500.00. The mail came from a debt collector “trying to collect a debt I owe to Bank of America, N.A.” In order to dispute the debt the mail states I need to write to the debt collection company before June 29th, 2023. Unfortunately that date had passed by the time my parents showed me the letter.

I then received another piece of mail (at their residency) from a bankruptcy firm stating that Bank of America has filed a lawsuit against me. In the mail there was a web address where I could look up information on the lawsuit - with the status “SUMMONS ISSUED TO ATTY BY AG (MY NAME)”. And a few days later someone showed up at my parents residence to serve papers to me, but since I do not live there the papers were not served.

What I’m trying to figure out is how to approach this. I’m unsure if Bank of America sold my debt - but everything I’ve read online states that Bank of America does not sell debt. I did my free annual credit report and was unable to see a creditor - I was only able to see that the account was charged off a while back. 

If I could pay a smaller portion of what I owe I would like to do that - as I still have other financial stresses to worry about. If I have to pay in full over time, then I can make that happen as well. What I want to avoid is going to court in another state or having my wages garnished. I’d rather tackle this head on. But where do I start? I do not want to file bankruptcy as I am paying off another credit card and eventually would like to settle with the others as well. 

Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

Bank of America,Bank of America accused of opening fake accounts and charging illegal junk fees,"Bank of America accused of opening fake accounts and charging illegal junk fees As someone who has been a Bank of America customer for 43 years, I'm not surprised by their poor customer service. They've taken away many services from their actual branches, and I've had to change my safety deposit box four times because they keep closing their banks in my area. I've lost count of how many times I've accidentally called them Capital One instead of Bank of America. Despite this, I have a very good checking account that meets all my needs, and they've been trying to get me to switch to a different account for years. However, I refuse to do so because I'll lose all the other benefits that I currently have. They're now charging me for checks and two checkbooks, which comes to a total of $27. If I change my account, those fees will be waived, but I don't want to lose everything else I have with them. It's important to note that Bank of America was founded as a Mafia bank, but I'm hesitant to switch because I have too many things tied up with them.

Bank of America,Is Bank of America always this incompetent?,"Is Bank of America always this incompetent? I have just had the most aggravating experience trying to close out a savings account in which my minor daughter & myself were the payable on death beneficiaries! My mom passed away last July and left behind a personal savings account that she used to set aside money for my daughter. My parents had done estate planning in 2018 & had a trust created so that probate would be avoided and my brother & I could easily close out their estates when they died. Their house and their joint accounts are part of this trust however my moms own personal savings account that she was using to save money for her granddaughter was NOT put in to the trust, specifically so that when she died, I could take out that money and give it to my daughter.

Long story short, BofA in Nevada where my parents live told my dad that all I had to do to get the $ from the savings account was to go to any branch here in CA where I live with the death certificate and my ID and they would give me the money and close the account. So I went to a local branch with those documents and they refused to close the account because they said I needed a letter, I forget what it's called. A week or so later I get said letter in the mail, fill it out and go back to the bank and this time I even brought my daughter and her ID. Was told I would get a check from the state in the mail. Thought that was weird but the gal helping me didn't seem familiar with POD accounts so I didn't question it. I ended up making 2-3 more trips to the bank because after each visit they would send me a letter with more forms to be signed by my dad who trustee of the family trust. Then they wanted my daughters birth certificate which I provided. The last letter they sent, they sent forms that my dad had to sign and have notarized. So he did that and sent them to me and I waited 10 months to try to deal with this again. 

Yesterday I made my final trip to BofA where right away the young man helping me told
Me that the savings account isn't part of the trust and that they don't need the documents I brought in. Manager got involved, confirmed he was right, called the estate unit to verify and first the estate unit said yes the account can be closed and paid out to me then they backtracked and said they can't do anything with the account because they need more documents from the trust! Manager had to tell them several times that the account is NOT IN THE TRUST so they shouldn't be asking me for trust paperwork when I am not even trustee and anyway an hour and 15 after I got there, I walked out with a cashiers check for the balance in the account! 

I cannot believe it took 2 bank branches and 5 attempts to close this account! Multiple employees accessed the account and yet only 1 was able to see that it wasn't part of a trust and needed to be handled like any other POD account! 

I closed my own BofA account 25 years ago and never regretted it. And I will never open an account with them again after this.",0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/14tv030/is_bank_of_america_always_this_incompetent/,07/08/2023,10:36:06,Admirable_Height3696,17,Other

Bank of America $BAC will pay $250 million in fines and restitution for engaging in unethical practices, including double-charging fees, withholding promised credit card perks, and opening accounts without customer authorization.

Banks can still engage in illegal and harmful practices, even after being punished for them in the past. This is not the first time that Bank of America has been fined for its practices. In 2010, the bank paid $13 Billion to settle charges that it had misled investors about the quality of its mortgage loans.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said that Bank of America violated a number of laws beginning in 2012:

1) The bank double-charged customers' fees for overdrafts, even when they had enough money in their accounts to cover the transactions.

2) Bank of America withheld promised credit card perks, such as cash rewards and bonus points.

3) The bank opened accounts without customer authorization, often by employees who were under pressure to meet sales goals.

Bank of America,Bank of America Scam,"Bank of America Scam I narrowly avoided falling for a very convincing scam. 

 I got a text message from Bank of America about fraudulent charges.  I logged onto the BoA website and there were 2 attempts at purchasing a Sam's Club membership.  As I was going through the screens on the BoA website, I got a robocall.  I answered and there was a recording saying ""this is BoA fraud department.  If we get disconnected, please call back at xxx-xxx-xxxx (I don't remember the number and I didn't write it down.)


A woman with a heavy indian accent comes on the line and says she has to verify my account and can she send me a code. (Red flag, but OK.)  A few seconds later, I get a text from BoA with a code and the warning that ""we will never call or text you asking for this code"" so I definitely wasn't giving out the code and I just hung up.  


This was really convincing because there ARE 2 fraudulent charges on my account and every text I received from BoA was real. I had previous texts from them about other transactions and logins. When I logged into my account, I used my bookmarked page and my password manager saved password popped up (which wouldn't have happened if it was a fake site without the right domain.) 


I don't know if the timing of the call was coincidental or not---I don't see how they could have known I was on the real BoA website looking into the fraudulent charges but since my phone rang as I was literally hitting ""submit"" on the fraud page, it made perfect sense to me that they would be calling asking for more details so they can investigate.  


Thank you to this subreddit!!  I knew immediately that I shouldn't give out the code so I saved myself a huge headache of being locked out of my credit card account.


EDIT:  I already contacted BoA to notify them, then they cancelled my card and they're sending me a new one.

Bank of America,[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer,"[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer About two weeks ago I opened a checking with BofA (because it's required for the Preferred Rewards program), opened an account with Merrill (to transfer in enough money to qualify for Platinum Honors), and then opened a CC with BofA (specifically, Premium Rewards Elite).

The initial deposit to the Checking went through fine, as did my transfer to Merrill (though that had to be done over the phone).  Now I'm trying to setup an external account for ongoing transfers into the BofA Checking and I'm striking out.

It looks like I have two methods to do it.

* The first is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""Wire/ACH"", and then ""Add Account/Recipient"".  When I do this, I fill out the form, it sends me a text, then I get an error ""Your account has not been added. We were unable to verify your account."", though curiously about 5 minutes later I get an email saying it was setup.

* The second method showed up after my CC was activated and is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""BofA Credit Cards"" and then ""Manage Accounts from Other Banks"".  When I fill this out it says ""Coming Soon. You'll have the ability to add accounts from other banks to make payments. Please check back again soon.""

I've gotten these errors with accounts at two different banks but I had no issue setting up both of them with the instant verification at Merrill which is supposedly identical.

I called their support for web & app this morning and as soon as they heard ""trying to pay credit card"" they transferred me to someone over there.  The CC people told me I could make a payment over the phone each month which is ridiculous.  They did check with someone technical who suggested using Chrome or Firefox instead of Edge, but that didn't help either.  I suspect making an appointment at a branch won't help either because I've had to do that twice already for different issues (in two weeks) and all they do is call the same toll-free number I was calling.

How do I get past this?  I'm not going to manually push money into BofA each month from an external account (which I've started the process of setting up this morning so that I can at the very least cover the current bill) and then make a manual payment from my Checking.  Auto Paying a CC via ACH from an external account is something that has been easy for 20+ years and somehow BofA has managed to make it impossible.

EDIT: Screenshots of the errors I'm getting https://imgur.com/a/CRR6nT7

Bank of America,"A recession and a credit crunch could result in 1 trillion of corporate deadbolts, Bank of America says","A recession and a credit crunch could result in 1 trillion of corporate deadbolts, Bank of America says Why does it seem like the market doesn’t really care about this information. 

My opinion is that office loan defaults are the elephant in the room for banks, which will cause ripple effects that may begin a stock market selloff. 

Either way office loans will either default or get moved to a bank special assets division (crappy loans), and either scenario will negatively affect a banks balance sheet, and should cause investors to sell, right?

I just don’t know what I’m missing here.

God help us when AI really takes over.  The human operation is bad enough and AI will perfect it.  We'd like to dispute a charge on our credit card which is a BOA card.  You all. no doubt, are familiar with the  with  the next available agent  who does not exist on the telephone and the suggestion that you use their convenient website instead.  Ever gone to the website?  Unless you want to immediately pay your bill, there is no way to communicate with them in a way that your communication will be in their records.  In our case, because the charge just appeared on the bill we recently received but is a week and a half old, there is literally no way to fit into their communication categories.  Their general information section claims that there is a message center.  If so, there is no way to find it.  They clearly don't want ordinary humans just fucking writing to them with something they might have to later explain not responding to.

Solution:  a letter written on paper, placed in an envelope, and stamped with proper postage.  Then, payment of the bill, less the disputed charge when due.  Copy of letter kept with note of date of mailing.

Amount causing all this trouble? $49.95.  Assholes!

Federal regulators accused Bank of America on Tuesday of harming customers by double-dipping on fees, withholding credit card rewards and opening fake accounts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay more than $100 million to customers and $90 million in penalties. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay $60 million in fines.

Some of the allegations are reminiscent of the Wells Fargo scandal last decade that involved opening millions of bank accounts without customer authorization. “Bank of America wrongfully withheld credit card rewards, double-dipped on fees, and opened accounts without consent,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. “These practices are illegal and undermine customer trust.

The losses are weighing on BofA's net interest margin, an important gauge of performance. BofA's stock has dropped 15% this year, making it the worst performer of any of its large rivals.  
  
Although BoA insists that these losses are merely on paper and it doesn't intend to sell these bonds, the reality remains that the bank's potential to generate income from its customer deposits could be significantly limited.  
  
The losses are the result of a strategy the bank implemented three years ago, when it pumped $670 billion in pandemic-era deposit inflows into debt markets.  
  
The value of BofA's securities portfolio has plunged as yields have risen and bond prices have fallen. At that time, bond prices were high and yields were low. However, as yields have risen and bond prices have dropped, BoA has seen a staggering loss in the value of its portfolio. This loss is double the figure reported by its biggest peers, reflecting the bank's aggressive strategy to favor bonds over cash.

NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BofA) (BAC.N) said on Monday it had begun a dialogue with the Federal Reserve to understand differing results between the central bank's stress test and the company's own under the Dodd-Frank Act.

Unlike rivals, BofA, the second-biggest U.S. lender, has not made any announcements about its dividend or share repurchases since the stress test results were published last week.

The Fed's annual test showed major lenders, including BofA, have enough capital to weather a severe economic slump, paving the way for them to issue share buybacks and dividends. to end the second quarter and the
But BofA wants to understand the differences in a category called ""other comprehensive income"" during a nine-quarter period measured in the test, it said in a statement.

The Federal Reserve declined to comment.

BofA's own analysis implied a worse result than the Fed's test last week, Piper Sandler analyst R. Scott Siefers said in a note published on Monday.

Bank of America,Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months.,"Why is Bank of America like this? BofA closed my accounts and now wants my personal income data every six months. I’m 34. I’ve had a BofA account since I was 16. In the last year, BofA closed all of my accounts (business and personal) because of an accusation of money laundering. The funds in question were all my salary from working as a traveling engineer in construction. They locked all of my accounts, sent every credit card balance to collections, and confiscated all of the money I had in my accounts. It took two weeks for income verification and ID verifications to process to unlock my accounts but all collections accounts were closed and remained in collections. 

When questioned, BofA representatives stated that they called me for a week several months prior to locking my accounts. They never called me because they “didn’t have my number” and they never sent me a letter because “they didn’t have my email or address.” But, I visited a local BofA branch when I needed money, I travel for work, and they email me statements every month…

It’s one year later and they have decided to call me every 3-6 months to confirm my employment details. They deleted most of my online details so I can’t see what I owe them. I have to call them to get a balance which means they could lie to me. I really want these buttheads out of my life!

&#x200B;

I've created a spreadsheet that contains 10 years of data from Bank of America's balance sheet and income statements, historical data for several popular multiples like P/B and P/TBV, and there are a couple valuation models such as Aswath Damodarans newest FCFE model for banks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As for the company, BAC seems to be a very popular holding in this community, and it's the largest bank that I've publicly valued. They just released second quarter earnings and they seem to be pretty upbeat, but after taking a deeper look at the company I was left with mixed feelings. My overall thoughts are that Bank of America is a sound bank, but I feel that it deserves to trade around its current market price. So, to further explain this I'm going to try my best to provide a detailed write up on what I found and why I think BAC is fairly valued. Fair warning though the write up is about 1,900 words, so if you just like looking at the numbers then feel free to skip this and go straight to the sheet!

&#x200B;

Out of the five banks I've looked at, BAC has the most held to maturity securities (making up 81.22% of their total securities), and their total debt securities (HTM and HFS securities) have been decreasing since 2021. Over the same time period they've managed to increase their interest bearing deposits, but non-interest bearing deposits have been leaving at a faster rate resulting in their total deposits decreasing 187.24b (-9.07%). Their risk-weighted assets and common shareholders' equity also haven't changed much over the past five years, but they have done a good job at increasing their net income (5 year CAGR of 9.38%). On a similar note, their ROE has been pretty good (TTM ROE of 12.92% / 5 year average of 12.15%), and they've consistently been increasing their tier 1 capital (Q2 tier 1 capital ratio of 15.22%).

&#x200B;

But just a little while ago they got hit with a fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for ""systematically double-dipping on fees imposed on customers with insufficient funds in their account, withholding reward bonuses explicitly promised to credit card customers, and misappropriating sensitive personal information to open accounts."" With this fine they will reportedly have to pay over $100m to customers, $90m in penalties to the CFPB, and $60m in penalties to the OCC, resulting in a total of roughly $250 million ([read the full article here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/bank-of-america-for-illegally-charging-junk-fees-withholding-credit-card-rewards-opening-fake-accounts/)). And while that fine may seem like a slap on the wrist, if regulators crack down on their ability to produce income from fees and commissions, which is their biggest source of non-interest income and accounted for \~30% of their total revenue this quarter, then their margins might begin to decline rather drastically. Now how much of their income from fees and commissions is actually attributable to these underhanded schemes is unknown, but it wouldn't surprise me if we start to see this line item decrease in the future.

&#x200B;

So, from my perspective it seems like BAC has been struggling to grow, and despite some of their impressive metrics it doesn't seem like they're going to have an underdog story. Based on their performance they seem like they're already as big as they're going to get, which in my mind paints a rather bleak outlook for the company. That said, I've copied Aswath Damodarans latest method of valuing a bank ([check out his video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdhTVs36z4c&t=1895s&ab_channel=AswathDamodaran)) and included 4 of these models on my spreadsheet. For this sheet I've decided to use the data from their latest quarterly statement so the models are based on TTM and Q2 numbers, all of this can be found on the sheet though, and my inputs and results for the models are as follows:

||Average Estimate|Low Estimate|Moderate Est.|High Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Risk-Adjusted Asset Growth (Years 1-5)|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|3.00%|
|Perpetual Asset Growth|1.58%|1.58%|1.58%|2.00%|
|Target T1 Capital Ratio|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|15.00%|
|Target ROE|9.14%|12.50%|13.14%|13.14%|
|Cost of Equity|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|11.67%|
|Estimated Value|$26.13|$33.95|$36.53|$36.87|

As of writing this BAC is trading at $31.66, and if you'd like to see all of the numbers check out the Est. pages on the spreadsheet.

&#x200B;

The Average Estimate is based on their historical figures. So, the 1.58% risk-adjusted asset growth rate is based on their 10 year CAGR of risk-adjusted assets, the target ROE of 9.14% is based on their average ROE over the past ten years, and the cost of equity is based on Aswath Damodarans calculations where he tried to find the average for the 25 largest US banks. So, I've stuck with his figure of 11.67% for consistency. Now I would normally use the average T1 capital ratio (13.17% in this case), but due to recent events and BAC increasing their T1 ratio to 15.22% in Q2 I'm going to say they'll try to maintain a ratio around 15%. Also, this does assume that their ROE will drop to levels last seen in 2020 (falling -29.28% TTM to year five), but I feel these assumptions are fitting given the recent turmoil and penalties they're facing. This all results in T1 capital increasing from Q2 to year five (14.41b / 6.59%), a 5.65% increase in common shareholders' equity, and based on their TTM net income of 28.24b it will have decrease 3.62b / 12.83% in steady state. And when you plug all these numbers in you end up with a price per share of $26.13 which is 17.46% lower than the market price.

&#x200B;

For the Low Est. it uses the same assumptions as the Average, except I assume that ROE will take a lesser hit and return to the 5 year average of 12.5% (-2.65% from 2022 to year 5). This still results in the same increase in T1 capital and common shareholders' equity due to the T1 capital ratio staying at 15% and thanks to assets growing from 1.44t in Q2 to 1.58t in steady state (up 141.59b / 9.86%). But since ROE will remain relatively high, their net income ends up increasing 4.48b / 15.87% to 32.72b in steady state. And these inputs result in a price per share of $32.29 which is 7.21% higher than the market price.

&#x200B;

Then the Moderate Est. uses the same growth rate for risk-weighted assets and T1 capital, but it has them staying on the higher end of their recent ROE. This is assuming the recent fines don't disturb their margins, but their median ROE over the past five years has been 13.14%, and their TTM ROE is 12.92% so it would only need to increase 1.67% over five years to arrive at the median value. This results in net income increasing from 28.24b (TTM) to 35.39b in steady state (up 7.15b / 25.31%), and a price per share of $36.53 which is 15.33% higher than the current price.

&#x200B;

And lastly, the High Est. uses the same 5 year median ROE as the Moderate one, but it assume that risk-adjusted assets will grow at 3% a year until year five and at that point it will grow at 2% in perpetuity. This causes risk-adjusted assets to grow to 1.697t (up 261.96b / 18.25%) and net income to increase to 37.59b (up 9.35b / 33.1%) in steady state. To do this and maintain a T1 capital ratio of 15% they would need to grow their T1 capital by 31.15b (14.25%) from Q2 to year five, and it results in common shareholders' equity increasing 12.21% over that time. All of this results in a price per share of $36.87 which is 16.42% higher than the current market price.

&#x200B;

Now this last estimate tells the high growth story that I assume most Bank of America investors would like to see, and it’s stories like this that inspired me to use multiple models when valuing a bank. I know I’m not perfect and I feel as though all of the assumptions I’m making are at least somewhat reasonable, so I try to approach the valuation from multiple perspectives to give me a better understanding of what others could be seeing. In the same vein, this also allows me to make more assumptions about the future so there’s less room for error, and in this case we can see that even if they have a great future the price I arrive at is still pretty close to the current price.

On another note, I feel as though the Moderate Est. is the most realistic one out of these four, but if you disagree or would like to make different assumptions all together then feel free to do so and let me know! Also, if you take the average of my four estimates you get a price per share of $33.37 which is 5.37% higher than the current market price, so regardless of which one of these estimates is the most realistic I think BAC is currently trading around its fair value. To back this up, I've looked at their average and median P/TBV, P/B, P/E, and P/S over the past ten years and my findings were as follows:

|Multiples|Current|Average|Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/TBV|1.45|1.42|1.39|
|P/B|1.03|1.00|0.98|
|P/E|9.94|20.59|16.67|
|P/S|2.70|2.33|2.33|

Out of these four multiples you can see that all of them, except for the P/E, are around their average and median values. Now I know the P/E is the most popular multiple and it's regarded as a relatively important one even for banks, but from what I've seen that doesn't seem to be the case for banks, and I think it will deserve a post of its own one day. I digress though, after calculating their historical multiples I looked at the inputs for these multiples for the current year and multiplied them by their average/median value to get a price per share. This price per share reflects what their market price would be based on their average/median multiple and their last reported value (EOY 2022 for consistency). For example, BAC has an average P/B of 0.9966 (which is rounded up to 1.00 on the chart), their book value of common shareholders' equity (per share) in 2022 was 30.61, so if they were to trade at their average P/B then the market price would be $30.51 (0.9966 \* 30.61).  And this leads me to the last chart that shows the market prices based on the aforementioned calculation:

|Multiples Continued|2022 Values|Price Based on Average|Price Based on Median|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tangible Book Value|21.83|$31.03|$30.29|
|Book Value|30.61|$30.51|$30.02|
|Earnings Per Share|3.19|$65.57|$53.08|
|Sales Per Share|11.75|$27.34|$27.38|
|Average||$38.61|$35.19|
|% Change to Average||21.92%|11.12%|

Again, as of writing this BAC closed the day at $31.66 which is higher than all of the average and median values except for their P/E, and in this case I would say that the P/E is definitely an outlier. But even if you include it in the data the average values of the price columns are within 22% of the current market price. So, from a multiples perspective I would not consider BAC a buy either, and between this, their less than astonishing financials, and my somewhat bleak outlook on their cashflows I will not be starting a position in Bank of America. Now, this isn't meant to be a hit piece on BAC by any means and I'm simply trying to explain my findings. So, I highly encourage people to take a look at the spreadsheet, and as stated earlier it contains ten years of data from their balance sheet and income statements, as well as price action data, multiples, and valuation models. On that note though, I hope you all enjoyed my first write up and I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts on Bank of America!",0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,0.9997,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1557v1o/bank_of_america_financial_statements_and_analysis/,07/21/2023,05:08:48,Benis_Benis_Benis,23,

I called immediately and was informed that the phone number I had listed wasn’t working, sure enough it was an old number. I apologized and fixed things with the number and verified that now, all was good. The CS rep said “yep! Everything looks good now. You should have your card in 7-10 business days!” Hung up the phone and went about my day. Until 7/3 when I received a letter inviting me to apply with a fake card in it. I called in customer service - just to be safe and they informed me that my account had been closed for failure to call when I received the letter. Spent around an hour on the phone with CS and the previous rep had not notated correctly and left out the notation stating that the phone number was updated. The system still had the correct phone number but because the CS rep didn’t notate it right they said there was nothing I could do unless I wanted to reapply. I laughed and said “hell no!” And got approved for the Wells Fargo active cash while I was on the phone.

Bank of America,Are there any other cards I should consider when I already have Bank of America Platinum Honors?,"Are there any other cards I should consider when I already have Bank of America Platinum Honors? As a Bank of America Platinum Honors preferred rewards member, I can get all of the following without leaving my bank or paying any fees:

* Customized Cash Rewards cards: 5.25% effective cash back on gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drug stores, and home improvement/furnishings. Only one category per card, but I can always get multiple cards to cover multiple categories or increase my category cap.
* Unlimited Cash Rewards card: 2.62% effective cash back on everything else not covered by one of the above.
* Travel Rewards card: no Foreign Transaction Fee and 2.62% effective cash back on everything, except I need to redeem the rewards for statement credits instead of getting direct cash back.

Is there really anything else worth considering for me? I see a lot of cards like the Wells Fargo Autograph and the Capital One SavorOne that look really nice, but 3% categories just don't look as good when compared to 2.62% on everything, and 5.25% on my most common categories.

To start this week the futures are pulling back a bit and with that, the VIX is starting the week off around 14 (the historical mean is around 19). This is the first full week of earnings season. Tomorrow we get a second round of big bank reports when we hear from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (Goldman is a day later) as well as a look into online brokerage with Schwab and Interactive Brokers. On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.

A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech. On the economic front this week is lighter than the past few. We get a speech today from ECB president Lagarde, retail sales on Tuesday, and then housing data and initial jobless claims later in the week. Some expected moves for notable earnings this week.

Bank of America,Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do?,"Bank of America filed lawsuit against me for unpaid credit card - What to do? Hello r/Debt,

I owned a restaurant with my biological family and after the pandemic came through the restaurant closed its doors. I had several credit cards at the time that I had to stop paying because I was unemployed. I made my last payment on my credit cards in October of 2021.

I’m now employed. I live and work in one state, but have kept my address back in another state at the house where my adoptive parents reside. I recently received mail at their residence from a debt collector regarding a credit card I had at Bank of America with an outstanding balance of less than $6,500.00. The mail came from a debt collector “trying to collect a debt I owe to Bank of America, N.A.” In order to dispute the debt the mail states I need to write to the debt collection company before June 29th, 2023. Unfortunately that date had passed by the time my parents showed me the letter.

I then received another piece of mail (at their residency) from a bankruptcy firm stating that Bank of America has filed a lawsuit against me. In the mail there was a web address where I could look up information on the lawsuit - with the status “SUMMONS ISSUED TO ATTY BY AG (MY NAME)”. And a few days later someone showed up at my parents residence to serve papers to me, but since I do not live there the papers were not served.

What I’m trying to figure out is how to approach this. I’m unsure if Bank of America sold my debt - but everything I’ve read online states that Bank of America does not sell debt. I did my free annual credit report and was unable to see a creditor - I was only able to see that the account was charged off a while back. 

If I could pay a smaller portion of what I owe I would like to do that - as I still have other financial stresses to worry about. If I have to pay in full over time, then I can make that happen as well. What I want to avoid is going to court in another state or having my wages garnished. I’d rather tackle this head on. But where do I start? I do not want to file bankruptcy as I am paying off another credit card and eventually would like to settle with the others as well. 

Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

They've taken away many services from their actual branches, and I've had to change my safety deposit box four times because they keep closing their banks in my area. I've lost count of how many times I've accidentally called them Capital One instead of Bank of America. Despite this, I have a very good checking account that meets all my needs, and they've been trying to get me to switch to a different account for years. However, I refuse to do so because I'll lose all the other benefits that I currently have. They're now charging me for checks and two checkbooks, which comes to a total of $27. If I change my account, those fees will be waived, but I don't want to lose everything else I have with them. It's important to note that Bank of America was founded as a Mafia bank, but I'm hesitant to switch because I have too many things tied up with them.

Their house and their joint accounts are part of this trust however my moms own personal savings account that she was using to save money for her granddaughter was NOT put in to the trust, specifically so that when she died, I could take out that money and give it to my daughter.

Long story short, BofA in Nevada where my parents live told my dad that all I had to do to get the $ from the savings account was to go to any branch here in CA where I live with the death certificate and my ID and they would give me the money and close the account. So I went to a local branch with those documents and they refused to close the account because they said I needed a letter, I forget what it's called. A week or so later I get said letter in the mail, fill it out and go back to the bank and this time I even brought my daughter and her ID. Was told I would get a check from the state in the mail. Thought that was weird but the gal helping me didn't seem familiar with POD accounts so I didn't question it. I ended up making 2-3 more trips to the bank because after each visit they would send me a letter with more forms to be signed by my dad who trustee of the family trust. Then they wanted my daughters birth certificate which I provided. The last letter they sent, they sent forms that my dad had to sign and have notarized. So he did that and sent them to me and I waited 10 months to try to deal with this again. 

Yesterday I made my final trip to BofA where right away the young man helping me told
Me that the savings account isn't part of the trust and that they don't need the documents I brought in. Manager got involved, confirmed he was right, called the estate unit to verify and first the estate unit said yes the account can be closed and paid out to me then they backtracked and said they can't do anything with the account because they need more documents from the trust! Manager had to tell them several times that the account is NOT IN THE TRUST so they shouldn't be asking me for trust paperwork when I am not even trustee and anyway an hour and 15 after I got there, I walked out with a cashiers check for the balance in the account! 

I cannot believe it took 2 bank branches and 5 attempts to close this account! Multiple employees accessed the account and yet only 1 was able to see that it wasn't part of a trust and needed to be handled like any other POD account! 

I closed my own BofA account 25 years ago and never regretted it. And I will never open an account with them again after this.",0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/14tv030/is_bank_of_america_always_this_incompetent/,07/08/2023,10:36:06,Admirable_Height3696,17,
Bank of America,"Bank of America $BAC will pay $250 million in fines and restitution for engaging in unethical practices, including double-charging fees, withholding promised credit card perks, and opening accounts without customer authorization.","Bank of America $BAC will pay $250 million in fines and restitution for engaging in unethical practices, including double-charging fees, withholding promised credit card perks, and opening accounts without customer authorization. Bank of America $BAC will pay $250 million in fines and restitution for engaging in unethical practices, including double-charging fees, withholding promised credit card perks, and opening accounts without customer authorization.

Banks can still engage in illegal and harmful practices, even after being punished for them in the past. This is not the first time that Bank of America has been fined for its practices. In 2010, the bank paid $13 Billion to settle charges that it had misled investors about the quality of its mortgage loans.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said that Bank of America violated a number of laws beginning in 2012:

1) The bank double-charged customers' fees for overdrafts, even when they had enough money in their accounts to cover the transactions.

2) Bank of America withheld promised credit card perks, such as cash rewards and bonus points.

3) The bank opened accounts without customer authorization, often by employees who were under pressure to meet sales goals.

Bank of America,Bank of America Scam,"Bank of America Scam I narrowly avoided falling for a very convincing scam. 

 I got a text message from Bank of America about fraudulent charges.  I logged onto the BoA website and there were 2 attempts at purchasing a Sam's Club membership.  As I was going through the screens on the BoA website, I got a robocall.  I answered and there was a recording saying ""this is BoA fraud department.  If we get disconnected, please call back at xxx-xxx-xxxx (I don't remember the number and I didn't write it down.)


A woman with a heavy indian accent comes on the line and says she has to verify my account and can she send me a code. (Red flag, but OK.)  A few seconds later, I get a text from BoA with a code and the warning that ""we will never call or text you asking for this code"" so I definitely wasn't giving out the code and I just hung up.  


This was really convincing because there ARE 2 fraudulent charges on my account and every text I received from BoA was real. I had previous texts from them about other transactions and logins. When I logged into my account, I used my bookmarked page and my password manager saved password popped up (which wouldn't have happened if it was a fake site without the right domain.) 


I don't know if the timing of the call was coincidental or not---I don't see how they could have known I was on the real BoA website looking into the fraudulent charges but since my phone rang as I was literally hitting ""submit"" on the fraud page, it made perfect sense to me that they would be calling asking for more details so they can investigate.  


Thank you to this subreddit!!  I knew immediately that I shouldn't give out the code so I saved myself a huge headache of being locked out of my credit card account.


EDIT:  I already contacted BoA to notify them, then they cancelled my card and they're sending me a new one.

The first time Coinbase send me this notifaction in March this year, I opened a ticket. The response was that I should not worry and that there would be more information to come later this year. I waited, now with the final mail, they went further and announced the deadline for close. I again opened a ticket just to be get a ChatGPT like answer that was referring to a completly different topic (how to verify that an e-mail is actually from coinbase using their domain model?!) than my request to get some background why my account was being close and whether there would be any actions to mitigate this from happening.

Bank of America,[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer,"[US] Bank of America - Can't setup External Account for transfer About two weeks ago I opened a checking with BofA (because it's required for the Preferred Rewards program), opened an account with Merrill (to transfer in enough money to qualify for Platinum Honors), and then opened a CC with BofA (specifically, Premium Rewards Elite).

The initial deposit to the Checking went through fine, as did my transfer to Merrill (though that had to be done over the phone).  Now I'm trying to setup an external account for ongoing transfers into the BofA Checking and I'm striking out.

It looks like I have two methods to do it.

* The first is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""Wire/ACH"", and then ""Add Account/Recipient"".  When I do this, I fill out the form, it sends me a text, then I get an error ""Your account has not been added. We were unable to verify your account."", though curiously about 5 minutes later I get an email saying it was setup.

* The second method showed up after my CC was activated and is under ""Pay & Transfer"", ""BofA Credit Cards"" and then ""Manage Accounts from Other Banks"".  When I fill this out it says ""Coming Soon. You'll have the ability to add accounts from other banks to make payments. Please check back again soon.""

I've gotten these errors with accounts at two different banks but I had no issue setting up both of them with the instant verification at Merrill which is supposedly identical.

I called their support for web & app this morning and as soon as they heard ""trying to pay credit card"" they transferred me to someone over there.  The CC people told me I could make a payment over the phone each month which is ridiculous.  They did check with someone technical who suggested using Chrome or Firefox instead of Edge, but that didn't help either.  I suspect making an appointment at a branch won't help either because I've had to do that twice already for different issues (in two weeks) and all they do is call the same toll-free number I was calling.

How do I get past this?  I'm not going to manually push money into BofA each month from an external account (which I've started the process of setting up this morning so that I can at the very least cover the current bill) and then make a manual payment from my Checking.  Auto Paying a CC via ACH from an external account is something that has been easy for 20+ years and somehow BofA has managed to make it impossible.

My opinion is that office loan defaults are the elephant in the room for banks, which will cause ripple effects that may begin a stock market selloff. 

Either way office loans will either default or get moved to a bank special assets division (crappy loans), and either scenario will negatively affect a banks balance sheet, and should cause investors to sell, right?

I just don’t know what I’m missing here.

You all. no doubt, are familiar with the  with  the next available agent  who does not exist on the telephone and the suggestion that you use their convenient website instead.  Ever gone to the website?  Unless you want to immediately pay your bill, there is no way to communicate with them in a way that your communication will be in their records.  In our case, because the charge just appeared on the bill we recently received but is a week and a half old, there is literally no way to fit into their communication categories.  Their general information section claims that there is a message center.  If so, there is no way to find it.  They clearly don't want ordinary humans just fucking writing to them with something they might have to later explain not responding to.

Solution:  a letter written on paper, placed in an envelope, and stamped with proper postage.  Then, payment of the bill, less the disputed charge when due.  Copy of letter kept with note of date of mailing.

Visa,AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”?,"AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”? Context: My mum is Thai, and my dad is Dutch. I grew up in Thailand.  My mum married again and I have a stepsister who is 3 years older than me. 

My stepsister always brings up stuff like “you have no idea how hard travelling is for us because you have a strong passport” whenever she’s feeling stressed about travelling. 

My family (me, mum, stepsister, stepdad), are currently planning a trip to Germany. They’re in the process of applying for a Schengen visa. I think seeing me relaxing and unstressed about the whole thing grated on my sister because I’m just chilling while they’re running around getting flight tickets, proof of accommodation, statement of purpose, bank statements, travel health insurance, money for the visa fee and a bunch more stuff. 

She finally snapped and was like “aren’t you even going to try to be helpful? At least share the visa fee with us”. I said no. I am financially contributing the same amount she is to the trip, the visa fee is just an added expense she has that I don’t. 

She was unhappy because “I just don’t get it” and kept telling me things would only be “fair” if I agreed to share that cost, at least.  She’s been giving me the cold shoulder since because she thinks I’m a bit of an ass. 

My mum would like me to apologise to her and agree to share the cost at which point she would then reimburse me just to keep the peace.",0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s7n71/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_the_cost_of_my/,07/06/2023,17:24:09,PersonalStation7321,554,Americas
Visa,Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays.,"Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays. My wife is non-European origin and visibly Muslim. She had an itinerary as follows MTL to London Heatherow to Istanbul international with the Airline and then her flight to her country with a separate airline. We live in Ontario - this post is on-going she is currently detained in Germany! A country she was never even supposed to be in.

Her first flight was delayed and she along with 100 others or so missed their connecting flights. After waiting in line for 2.5 hrs in London she was given a new ticket and told to run to the gate so she might make it to Istanbul on time. The new flight routed her through a small German airport that didn't have an international transit area. 

My wife gets off the plane runs towards her next gate because the flights were really close and when she gets to passport control 
 she is detained by Germain passport control for not having a German visa ( doesn't have a Canadian passport yet). 
She is given a criminal offense- unlawful entry, is humiliated in public by being escorted by police. She is searched and held in a holding area  until a flight out can be arranged. This is her second international trip the first was to Canada. She was balling and crying for hours, 20 hrs in her voice is still shaking when she talks to me.

 This was a direct assault on our dignity and she was treated like a criminal and detained for what will be about 24 hrs by the time shes escorted to her flight to Istanbul ( new flight). 

Airline did nothing to help. I called several times, they ran us around and finally suggested I need to buy new ticket to get her to Istanbul or Canada.
 They dumped her in the wrong country then tell us we have to spend more money to get her to the destination all because she was detained due to their negligence.  I'm livid. Sorry for the inconvenience they say. Apparently getting arrested in a foreign country you had no intention of visiting and then being banned from entry for life is an inconvenience.  

She is traumatized and still in detention her flight out is in a few hours and needless to say her final flight had to also be repurchased..I want to sue the Airline all legal advice is appreciated.

Her new flight is with another airline. The last I heard from the first airline is "" they are trying to get in touch with German authorities"". Not once did they call her...",-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/151nte9/airline_got_my_wife_detained_by_routing_her/,07/17/2023,06:25:58,talktomesexytimes,265,Americas

Visa,Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland,"Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland Liebe Gewerbetreibende,

ich bin gerade mal wieder im Urlaub... Letztes Mal in Schweden, dieses Mal in Frankreich. Was mir mal wieder massiv auffällt: ich konnte in Schweden bei der kleinsten Eisbude im Hinterland mit VISA zahlen und hier in Frankreich ist es das Selbe: ich kann an jeder noch so kleinen Bumsbude mit der VISA zahlen. Kein Problem!

Warum verflucht nochmal bekommen es andere EU Länder hin selbst bei Pommesbuden VISA Karte als Zahlungsmittel zu haben und wir in Deutschland können nicht mal in Touristenorten in allen Geschäften mit VISA Zahlen. In der Eisdiele erwarte ich es ja nicht mal - obwohl auch das kein Problem zu sein scheint - aber verflucht nochmal warum in Geschäften nicht?

Ich bin mittlerweile an einem Punkt angekommen an dem ich ein Geschäft wieder verlasse wenn keine Visa akzeptiert wird. Dann macht den Umsatz eben ein Anderer. Die Höhe war vor dem Urlaub meine Werkstatt: beim Bezahlen mit der Visa fragt mich der Werkstattmeister (und Eigentümer), ob ich nicht eine andere Karte dabei habe, bei VISA bekommt er nicht den vollen Betrag... Weil ihm das bei den Apothekenpreisen seiner Leistungen auch das Bein bricht wenn ~1,2% Gebühren weg gehen. War das letzte Mal, dass ich mein Auto bei ihm abgegeben habe, das hab ich ihm auch gesagt. Finde das unverschämt, Geld verdienen wollen aber nichts dafür ausgeben wollen.

Liebe Gewerbetreibende! Rafft euch mal. Bietet VISA an und geht mit der Zeit. Es kann nicht sein, dass wir in Deutschland bei den Zahlungsmitteln auf dem Stand der 90er stehen bleiben, nur weil ihr 1,2% mehr Gewinn machen könntet. Falls ihr wegen den 1,2% nicht mehr profitabel seid sperrts den Laden bitte zu... Dann habt ihr eh ein Problem. Kommt mal im Jahr 2023 an... Bitte! Danke!

Now he moved out since spring and I informed all the authorities but they didn't react yet. I am a citizen here but I still feel sad and used and I want all of this to end. Also he is violent and I am scared to go outside or do something like work or meeting friends.

What do you think I can do legally? I am 100% sure now that he used me for visa and showed his true colors after his arrival. As he refused to divorce, we strated a trial but it won't move forward until the end of the year. If he is allowed to stay here, I have to move out but its hard for me as I lived here my whole life and I don't deserve all of that.

Visa,Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore.,"Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore. Background: 

I arrived in Thailand July 2021 and stayed with COVID extensions until October 2022. After that, I arranged an education visa that went into effect January 2023 and expires January 2024. 

I never broke the law in Thailand or had any other issues with the authorities here. 

However, despite doing everything by the book and securing a reentry permit before leaving Thailand, and despite being cleared at the airport and allowed to enter Thailand through Phuket, Thai immigration just denied my education visa renewal after I made my appointment with them this morning. 

Their reasoning is that I travelled on the education visa too frequently.

These were my trips:

1) One trip to Israel in March 2023 to help my dad with health issues. 

2) One trip to Dubai in May 2023 for only 3 days. 

3) Another trip to Israel after my dad recently suffered a stroke and almost died in July 2023. 

The immigration officer didn't care about my story, either. I was just another number to them. 

Sometimes life throws you punches. Not only did I almost just lose my dad this month, but I just lost my home in Thailand. But it's OK. Everything happens for a reason, and I planned on returning to Israel very shortly as it is to continue taking care of my dad. I'm just posting this as a warning to others: do not rely on education visas any longer. Thai authorities are cracking down on them, and they are not a good way to live in Thailand long term if you need to travel.

Visa,PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you!,"PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you! This situation is ASB-specific, but it seems possible to me that other banks might be affected too. If you bank with ASB, you need to know this, and if you don't, it's probably still a good idea for you to call your bank and ask how they handle it.

The story goes: A week ago, I used the ASB mobile app's 'cancel and replace card' feature. I had loaded my ASB VISA debit card details into a family member's Uber account, and in an abundance of caution, once that was no longer needed, I figured I should cancel and replace the card. It doesn't hurt to do that every year or two regardless, as a general security principle, right?

So I did the 'cancel and replace' thing in the app.

It's a week later now, and I still haven't received the new card in the mail, but that's just because NZ Post is shit. Anyway, I'm idly reviewing my bank transactions today, as you do, and I see that my monthly Playstation Network subscription has been successfully charged to my ASB account. Now, I'd forgotten about that PSN subscription that I'd set up on the now-cancelled card. All PSN had was my old ASB debit VISA card details. I should've received an email from PSN complaining about a failed payment. Yet they're still successfully charging me!

So I called ASB customer service, and had an interesting conversation with a very nice lady, who explained:

- There is a feature offered by VISA and MasterCard where a merchant who is going to process recurring card transactions can get a 'secure token' to charge, instead of using the actual card details themselves. (This seems like a good security feature to me - the customer support lady wasn't really familiar with how it worked, but I assume the token can only be used to initiate charges by the merchant it was issued to, meaning that if the merchant's stored payment data is stolen, nobody can use the info to make fraudulent card transactions. Good design, props to VISA and MasterCard.)

- These 'chargeable secure tokens' are created by the card-issuing bank, when a merchant provides a customer's card details and requests a token.

- In ASB's case, it seems that the tokens are linked *to your bank account*, as if they were entirely separate debit cards, not *to the card itself*. So, when you cancel and replace a card, you effectively, unbeknownst to you, can have any number of 'virtual card' tokens still floating around out in the world, held by the merchants who asked your bank for them, and those merchants can still use them to take money off you, regardless of whether the card details you originally gave them are still valid or not.

- ASB customer service workers have a standing instruction, when someone calls up to ask to cancel and replace a card, to manually go through and delete all of the 'virtual card tokens' linked to that customer's accounts in their system.

- However, if a customer just uses the 'cancel and replace card' feature in the ASB mobile app, there is no mention of these 'virtual card tokens', no mention that you need to call customer service to complete the cancellation process, and no automated deletion of any virtual card tokens. The tokens just stay there in ASB's system, and the merchants who created them can keep using them to charge you, until you call up ASB customer service and ask them to manually delete the tokens.

So, if you're an ASB customer, and you need to cancel and replace a debit or credit card, and you want to be sure that nobody who you gave the old card details to can still charge you through it: *you have to telephone customer support, you cannot rely on doing it via the mobile app*.

For non-ASB customers: If I were you, I'd call my bank and ask how this stuff is handled. Does your bank automatically delete all current virtual card tokens when the debit or credit card used to create them is cancelled?

And, if anyone senior at ASB is reading this: for god's sake, guys, start keeping a record of what card was used to create each virtual card token, and automatically invalidate the tokens when the card is invalidated! How did that not get designed in from the start? At the very least, update your mobile banking app's cancel-and-replace feature to pop up a warning that recurring charges might still be processed against the cancelled card unless the customer calls ASB's customer support line!

Editing to share a realization I had while engaging in the comments below:

This system behaviour, as disturbing as it is for us schmucks out there swiping our cards, benefits merchants by making it easier for them to take our money.

Merchants pay the transaction fees each time a card is swiped. So the *merchants* are the bank's customers for card products.

And so the banks are going to design their systems in whatever way makes the merchants happiest.

This will be why none of us have ever seen proactive advertising from our banks explaining how this system works.

Because if we all knew about it, if it was fully in the public eye, enough of us might be unhappy about it that it might be difficult for the banks to keep doing it. The banks might have to change to deleting tokens by default on card cancels, or maybe just ensuring that we're told about it and given a clear choice on what will happen. Imagine if the Banking Ombudsman decided that this was something that banks had a responsibility to ensure that customers were made fully aware of, instead of only mentioning it when customers asked about unexpected charges?",0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/14nn025/psa_i_learned_today_that_cancelling_and_replacing/,07/01/2023,10:50:15,jrandom_42,123,Americas

Visa,"Senior dev on a Visa, underpaid and fulfilling other roles","Senior dev on a Visa, underpaid and fulfilling other roles *My goal with this post is to bring visibility of what some companies do to their immigrants, how some of us can get stuck in the bureaucracy of US immigration laws and to get some love from peers during complex work statuses.*

Hi, 12 years of experience dev here, I currently live in the Austin, Texas, I got transferred here 4 years with an L1. Worked for the same company for 9 years and made my way as senior dev here. Joined them when it was a start up and now is a multi national company in public market (it got acquired).

After many years of back and forth with different company managers I accepted the Visa to be transferred here with the goal of get promoted as a tech lead or team manager. 4 years later that never happened. I asked multiple times what are they waiting for and the answer is that they are waiting for my green card to be approved (the company lawyers are working on it but they haven't filed it yet).

My reality now is that they are keeping me underpaid ($70K), asking for raise leads to the same answer as for my promotion. My engineering manager quit and I'm fulfilling that role as I'm the only senior dev in the team, and the company is not opening a new manager position.

I know that the easy answer is ""quit"", but in the case of my visa that means to get back to my country (which I don't want). I'm currently in the process of getting a green card on my own means but it takes time.

What things can I do to make this time until a get my green card a bit better?

Have you meet any other co workers in the same situation?

Visa,How is Brandan going to stay in the Philippines if he doesn’t have a visa?,"How is Brandan going to stay in the Philippines if he doesn’t have a visa? I was just thinking this guy most likely didn’t apply for a visa. I really think he didn’t apply for any type of visa. Then it had me thinking how can he be there without a visa?? From my understanding you would need some type of visa to stay in a country. He seems like he’s going to be doing nothing. Probably because Mary wouldn’t want him to work because there’s a chance he’ll work with women. From my experience I was thinking of going to South Korea with my boyfriend and I was going to teach English there. I would have needed a work visa for that. If Brandan was smart enough he should have went to the Philippines as an English teacher. It’s pretty easy to get a visa for that and it’s so high in demand. But I’m assuming he didn’t even think of that and Mary wouldn’t let him because of her jealously issues.

I’m just confused what is he going to do to stay there legally?? This couple is so confusing I have no words-",-0.8327,-0.8327,-0.8327,-0.8327,https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayFiance/comments/14xljxa/how_is_brandan_going_to_stay_in_the_philippines/,07/12/2023,16:13:12,moonxlight101,147,Americas

Visa,I got my Australian visa! What next?,"I got my Australian visa! What next? So ayun. After almost 5 years of waiting, processing documents, and more waiting. I finally have my permanent residence visa!

Anyway, I did my research and eto yung mga na -note ko na need ko gawin. Sa mga nakapag migrate na, pwede pakidagdagan kasi baka may importante pala akong nakalimutan. Haha

Before actually flying to Australia

1. Take the PDOS seminar para magkaron ng CFO sticker sa passport (kita ko may online seminar pero just wondering kung pano makukuha yung sticker kung online yung pinili?)
2. Secure enough funds for food, utilities, rent for first few months na wala pang work sa Australia (I actually plan na maghanap na ng work bago pa pumunta dun pero syempre para lang safe, plan ko magbudget kahit 3 mos worth)
3. Renew my PH drivers license (kasi sabi nila nacconvert daw to sa AU drivers license)
4. Talk to my PH banks to arrange yung mga OTP

Once I land in AU

1. Get an AU sim card
2. Open an AU bank account
3. Apply for Tax File Number, Centrelink Number, Medicare Number
4. Secure a rental property

Tapos, bilang galing tayo sa Pilipinas na sobrang tagal lagi anything related sa government, do you think mabilis lang makukuha yung mga nasa No. 3? Iniisip ko kasi mag airbnb muna ko sa 1st month ko pagdating AU habang wala pa kong nahahanap na rental property na long term. Kaso pano pag nagbago na ako ng address sa next month. Baka ipadala ung docs dun sa dati kong airbnb e nakalipat na ko sa ibang rental property? Or baka may iba kayong tips para dito? Wala kasi talaga ako kakilala don sa AU so pakikitira is not an option :(",0.9239,0.9239,0.9239,0.9239,https://www.reddit.com/r/phmigrate/comments/1577z9d/i_got_my_australian_visa_what_next/,07/23/2023,12:18:41,dreambigdreams01,72,Americas

Visa,"Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa","Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa I don't have other place to express my happiness then tell everyone on reddit. A little backstory we are not from USA. 

My brother (33M) is the worst scum of earth. I grew up in a chauvinist, cultish household where I had to behave so I didn't tarnish my family and no matter what happened my brother was the golden child. 

My brother would physically hurt my sisters and I, would make degrading comments like we were fat or ugly, critize our clothes, our cooking, our cleaning, yet he barely graduated HS. In the eyes of my parents he was not doing anything wrong, they would just tell him ""stop bothering your sisters"" and that was it. My brother grew up diminishing my sisters and I, I would cry in my room about the level of abuse.

My brother is a freeloader that hasn't work a single job in his life in our home country yet he went to USA to visit some relatives and decided to work on a tourist visa (as you know this is a HUGE no-no). From there on my brother thought of living in USA and never come back to my home country. 

Of course once the visa renewal came it was denied, my brother was heartbroken because obviously he has no work experience, single, has a Business degree (he graduated with the minimum requirements). He would tell my sisters and I to yive money monthly for house expenses and food, but I knew he was taking a portion to himself. 

He continued to be an a-hole but one day I decided to be the bigger person and open up to him, he stopped me and told me to my face ""I don't care about your life"". That was the moment I shut myself with him. And after years of abuse and discrimination for being a woman I found out he applied a second time for a visa and it was once again denied.

8 June at 9:22 am: Notification of Electronic VISA ISSUANCE email (SE)

Error message on my ""Visa Application list"" that I was advised to ignore:
""An error occurred in process of inspection of the file. Upload a file again. passport number Pxxxxxxxx Name of the file null""
This error message was on my account from 30th May for about 3-4 days. But there was nothing I could do; no option to re-upload my passport, so I ignored it as advised by the consulate and customer hotline when I called them, respectively. 

Uploaded documents:
1. Passport photo (white background)
2. Passport copy (bio page and the following page) 
3. Emirates ID copy
4. Flight itinerary (already booked but pre-booking works as per requirements)
5. Bank statement last 3 months
6. Certificate of Employment (NOT NOC)
7. Schedule of Stay (use the form they provide on the website)
8. Hotel booking confirmation (pre-booking)
9. Residence visa copy (document to prove legal residency)

Notes: 
1. I uploaded all the above in pdf format, except for my passport photo. If you have more than one file per required document, you should upload in jpg or PNG format. 
However, even though I have 2 accommodations, I just merged them in 1 file and uploaded it in pdf like the rest.
 
2. Some required fields (like the hotel booking information) have limited character spaces, so if for example you have 2 accommodations, just write the contact number of the accommodation where you will stay the longest. As for the hotel name, try to write both. (What's more important is you write all your accommodation info on the Schedule of Stay form)

3. Schedule of Stay form. Just write ""Arrival to Japan via xx airport"" on your Day 0. I also added my accommodation info on Day 0 as this is the day I am moving there from the airport.

Visa,Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰,"Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰 Hi folks! I just want to let out a small rant. I'm from the UK and have been fortunate enough to spend a decent amount of time in Sydney. Between 2017-2018 I was here on a sponsored visa. I was promised by my employer that the move would be ""permanent"" so I invested quite heavily into ""settling down"" here. Only to learn 20 months later that my employer had botched my visa application and I suddenly found myself with 30 days to leave the country. I had an apartment filled with belongings, a girlfriend, and I had to abandon it all.

So back I was in the UK. It would take me another 3 years before I found a new Australian work sponsor, and another 4 years before I would actually arrive back here. That takes us to July 2022. I've been here (again) for a year now. And I have just been made redundant. I basically have 6 weeks to find a new sponsor before I have to leave everything behind again.

But I have always had to prepare for this possibility. I always knew it could happen. And that brings us back to the title of this post. Being here on a temporary visa without the security of being allowed to remain here is super stressful, because on the one hand, you want to try and build a life here, because ultimately I would like to get permanent residency, and I am living here full-time. But on the other hand, you have to be prepared to give it all up in a heartbeat. It means you cannot really let your guard down or really ever feel comfortable. You are always on edge.

It's been more than 6 years since I first had it in my head that I want to make Australia my home, I really do love it here compared to the UK. I'm in a fairly decent positive to make it happen, but it's still 50/50, and I could still be many years off making it happen.

That's about it really. I really just wanted to vent. I'm not complaining about the process or requesting any special treatment. Just wanted to express that life is good here, and there are many people (like me) who are sacrificing the best years of their lives just for a chance of being able to settle down here.

Visa,Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal,"Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal I booked my honeymoon package for greece and paid half of the amount (₹170000) in first week of April. Makemytrip visa team got in touch with me with list of documents to be submitted. I started preparing the required documents including bank statements, and affidavits from both of our parents as we were appearing for visa appointment before wedding. Got all the documents verified by the makemytrip visa team (Rubi was the POC). Me and my then fiancee (now wife) appeared for the visa appointment and submitted documents on April 21st. Total silence from GVCW (agency that takes documents for tourist visa and sends it to greek embassy for further processing) and the greek embassy. The next installment of payment to MMT was due on 30th may. I was really worried as there was no communication about visa processing, was really skeptical to pay the remaining half amount. Got in touch with my MakeMyTrip relationship manager (my poc for this booking) Ruchi and cried about this - that i didnt want to pay the rest as I am worried. She insisted I paid the full amount as visa will be processed - she said she knows people got greek visa recently who booked with MMT. I asked for extension if possible, she denied straight and asked me to pay or else she said the full booking would be cancelled. I paid as I was worried about loosing the already paid amount in case visa gets approved and bookings are cancelled. 
Approx around 17th of June, got my passport back with visa refusal letter with a reason: “The information submitted regarding the justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable”. The documents related to booking of flights and hotels were all provided by Makemytrip. All of these documents were verified by Makemytrip visa team. Still got this refusal.

I called the airline (Indigo) with the reason - they mentioned that booking can be cancelled and I can get around ₹90000 refund. Similarly I called all the hotels and they confirmed that they would refund the amount as the reason is genuine and they don’t have a problem to refund as this was almost 20days before the trip dates. All the other bookings were fully refundable as I checked the policies on individual products/service/experience websites. 
I got in touch with MMT visa team, they asked me to send the refusal letter over an email which I did. After that I got in touch with my RO (Ruchi) - she was copied in my email. After many attempts she picked up the call and said that okay I will process the cancellation - I told about the airline and hotel refunds - to which she said if that is the case I should have no problem getting my money back less some cancellation penalty. 

I got email from Indigo that booking has been cancelled and refund amount is approx ₹90000.

After this Ruchi stopped responding to my whatsapp messages and stopped picking up my calls. 

On July 14th Ruchi responds to my whatsapp ping and says there is no refund. 

I am feeling like I am scammed. MMT made me pay fully, they processed bookings, told me what documents to submit for visa - they got the refunds but I have to face big financial loss for no reason. I am not sure how I can even measure my mental trauma. This was supposed to be my honeymoon trip and it ends like this. How can makemytrip keep all this refund money?

I was curious to know how Pearl was able to move to the UK and spew her bullshit, since I'm also an immigrant to the UK and know for a fact there is no visa that allows her to do what she does. 

On twitter, she's said she moved here to play professional volleyball. You're only allowed to do VERY specific second jobs on a sports/work visa and sure as hell NOT allowed to start a 'business' and employ a team of editors etc. as Pearl has said.

Her name is not listed as a registered business owner in the UK. She is probably paying her 'team' under the table, not paying UK taxes, and if she's making more than ~$100,000, she's evading USA tax as well.

On twitter she's said she wants to move back to the USA, but damn, if the Home Office finds out what she's been probably doing here, her dumbass could perma banned from entering the UK and convicted of tax fraud in both the UK and USA.

Again, this is all **IN MY OPINION** but the fact that she's seemed to blow up very fast online tells me she did not have this all worked out with immigration and tax lawyers and is probably doing a lot of illegal shit under the radar.",-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/14bypfv/pear_is_100_violating_the_terms_of_her_visa_in/,06/17/2023,23:55:19,marius_ann,90,Americas

If you are applying for a visa around this time and you have a deadline you need to meet, then you should strongly consider paying for priority service. My personal suggestion:

* If you need to travel in less than 8 weeks, get priority service
* If you need to travel within 1-3 weeks, get super priority

There is NO point in calling/emailing the hotline (a 3rd party service staffed by Sitel UK, not UKVI) to escalate your visa decision because you don't have it quickly enough. We don't have any evidence that the call centre actually follows any protocol for escalation, and from what I've seen, they tell everyone they've ""escalated"" with no indication they've actually done so, unless the case is exceptional. The hotline is intended to take your money and fob you off.

Realistically, you should be prepared to pay for a faster service if you have to be in the UK at a certain time. Please remember to apply as early in advance as possible (usually 3 months for most visas).",0.816,0.816,0.816,0.816,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1598ega/reminder_student_visa_season_affects_all_visa/,07/25/2023,18:21:30,clever_octopus,26,Americas

Visa,AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”?,"AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”? Context: My mum is Thai, and my dad is Dutch. I grew up in Thailand.  My mum married again and I have a stepsister who is 3 years older than me. 

My stepsister always brings up stuff like “you have no idea how hard travelling is for us because you have a strong passport” whenever she’s feeling stressed about travelling. 

My family (me, mum, stepsister, stepdad), are currently planning a trip to Germany. They’re in the process of applying for a Schengen visa. I think seeing me relaxing and unstressed about the whole thing grated on my sister because I’m just chilling while they’re running around getting flight tickets, proof of accommodation, statement of purpose, bank statements, travel health insurance, money for the visa fee and a bunch more stuff. 

She finally snapped and was like “aren’t you even going to try to be helpful? At least share the visa fee with us”. I said no. I am financially contributing the same amount she is to the trip, the visa fee is just an added expense she has that I don’t. 

She was unhappy because “I just don’t get it” and kept telling me things would only be “fair” if I agreed to share that cost, at least.  She’s been giving me the cold shoulder since because she thinks I’m a bit of an ass. 

My mum would like me to apologise to her and agree to share the cost at which point she would then reimburse me just to keep the peace.",0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s7n71/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_the_cost_of_my/,07/06/2023,17:24:09,PersonalStation7321,554,Europe
Visa,Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays.,"Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays. My wife is non-European origin and visibly Muslim. She had an itinerary as follows MTL to London Heatherow to Istanbul international with the Airline and then her flight to her country with a separate airline. We live in Ontario - this post is on-going she is currently detained in Germany! A country she was never even supposed to be in.

Her first flight was delayed and she along with 100 others or so missed their connecting flights. After waiting in line for 2.5 hrs in London she was given a new ticket and told to run to the gate so she might make it to Istanbul on time. The new flight routed her through a small German airport that didn't have an international transit area. 

My wife gets off the plane runs towards her next gate because the flights were really close and when she gets to passport control 
 she is detained by Germain passport control for not having a German visa ( doesn't have a Canadian passport yet). 
She is given a criminal offense- unlawful entry, is humiliated in public by being escorted by police. She is searched and held in a holding area  until a flight out can be arranged. This is her second international trip the first was to Canada. She was balling and crying for hours, 20 hrs in her voice is still shaking when she talks to me.

 This was a direct assault on our dignity and she was treated like a criminal and detained for what will be about 24 hrs by the time shes escorted to her flight to Istanbul ( new flight). 

Airline did nothing to help. I called several times, they ran us around and finally suggested I need to buy new ticket to get her to Istanbul or Canada.
 They dumped her in the wrong country then tell us we have to spend more money to get her to the destination all because she was detained due to their negligence.  I'm livid. Sorry for the inconvenience they say. Apparently getting arrested in a foreign country you had no intention of visiting and then being banned from entry for life is an inconvenience.  

She is traumatized and still in detention her flight out is in a few hours and needless to say her final flight had to also be repurchased..I want to sue the Airline all legal advice is appreciated.

Her new flight is with another airline. The last I heard from the first airline is "" they are trying to get in touch with German authorities"". Not once did they call her...",-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/151nte9/airline_got_my_wife_detained_by_routing_her/,07/17/2023,06:25:58,talktomesexytimes,265,Europe

Visa,Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland,"Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland Liebe Gewerbetreibende,

ich bin gerade mal wieder im Urlaub... Letztes Mal in Schweden, dieses Mal in Frankreich. Was mir mal wieder massiv auffällt: ich konnte in Schweden bei der kleinsten Eisbude im Hinterland mit VISA zahlen und hier in Frankreich ist es das Selbe: ich kann an jeder noch so kleinen Bumsbude mit der VISA zahlen. Kein Problem!

Warum verflucht nochmal bekommen es andere EU Länder hin selbst bei Pommesbuden VISA Karte als Zahlungsmittel zu haben und wir in Deutschland können nicht mal in Touristenorten in allen Geschäften mit VISA Zahlen. In der Eisdiele erwarte ich es ja nicht mal - obwohl auch das kein Problem zu sein scheint - aber verflucht nochmal warum in Geschäften nicht?

Ich bin mittlerweile an einem Punkt angekommen an dem ich ein Geschäft wieder verlasse wenn keine Visa akzeptiert wird. Dann macht den Umsatz eben ein Anderer. Die Höhe war vor dem Urlaub meine Werkstatt: beim Bezahlen mit der Visa fragt mich der Werkstattmeister (und Eigentümer), ob ich nicht eine andere Karte dabei habe, bei VISA bekommt er nicht den vollen Betrag... Weil ihm das bei den Apothekenpreisen seiner Leistungen auch das Bein bricht wenn ~1,2% Gebühren weg gehen. War das letzte Mal, dass ich mein Auto bei ihm abgegeben habe, das hab ich ihm auch gesagt. Finde das unverschämt, Geld verdienen wollen aber nichts dafür ausgeben wollen.

Liebe Gewerbetreibende! Rafft euch mal. Bietet VISA an und geht mit der Zeit. Es kann nicht sein, dass wir in Deutschland bei den Zahlungsmitteln auf dem Stand der 90er stehen bleiben, nur weil ihr 1,2% mehr Gewinn machen könntet. Falls ihr wegen den 1,2% nicht mehr profitabel seid sperrts den Laden bitte zu... Dann habt ihr eh ein Problem. Kommt mal im Jahr 2023 an... Bitte! Danke!

Visa,Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore.,"Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore. Background: 

I arrived in Thailand July 2021 and stayed with COVID extensions until October 2022. After that, I arranged an education visa that went into effect January 2023 and expires January 2024. 

I never broke the law in Thailand or had any other issues with the authorities here. 

However, despite doing everything by the book and securing a reentry permit before leaving Thailand, and despite being cleared at the airport and allowed to enter Thailand through Phuket, Thai immigration just denied my education visa renewal after I made my appointment with them this morning. 

Their reasoning is that I travelled on the education visa too frequently.

These were my trips:

1) One trip to Israel in March 2023 to help my dad with health issues. 

2) One trip to Dubai in May 2023 for only 3 days. 

3) Another trip to Israel after my dad recently suffered a stroke and almost died in July 2023. 

The immigration officer didn't care about my story, either. I was just another number to them. 

Sometimes life throws you punches. Not only did I almost just lose my dad this month, but I just lost my home in Thailand. But it's OK. Everything happens for a reason, and I planned on returning to Israel very shortly as it is to continue taking care of my dad. I'm just posting this as a warning to others: do not rely on education visas any longer. Thai authorities are cracking down on them, and they are not a good way to live in Thailand long term if you need to travel.

Visa,PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you!,"PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you! This situation is ASB-specific, but it seems possible to me that other banks might be affected too. If you bank with ASB, you need to know this, and if you don't, it's probably still a good idea for you to call your bank and ask how they handle it.

The story goes: A week ago, I used the ASB mobile app's 'cancel and replace card' feature. I had loaded my ASB VISA debit card details into a family member's Uber account, and in an abundance of caution, once that was no longer needed, I figured I should cancel and replace the card. It doesn't hurt to do that every year or two regardless, as a general security principle, right?

So I did the 'cancel and replace' thing in the app.

It's a week later now, and I still haven't received the new card in the mail, but that's just because NZ Post is shit. Anyway, I'm idly reviewing my bank transactions today, as you do, and I see that my monthly Playstation Network subscription has been successfully charged to my ASB account. Now, I'd forgotten about that PSN subscription that I'd set up on the now-cancelled card. All PSN had was my old ASB debit VISA card details. I should've received an email from PSN complaining about a failed payment. Yet they're still successfully charging me!

So I called ASB customer service, and had an interesting conversation with a very nice lady, who explained:

- There is a feature offered by VISA and MasterCard where a merchant who is going to process recurring card transactions can get a 'secure token' to charge, instead of using the actual card details themselves. (This seems like a good security feature to me - the customer support lady wasn't really familiar with how it worked, but I assume the token can only be used to initiate charges by the merchant it was issued to, meaning that if the merchant's stored payment data is stolen, nobody can use the info to make fraudulent card transactions. Good design, props to VISA and MasterCard.)

- These 'chargeable secure tokens' are created by the card-issuing bank, when a merchant provides a customer's card details and requests a token.

- In ASB's case, it seems that the tokens are linked *to your bank account*, as if they were entirely separate debit cards, not *to the card itself*. So, when you cancel and replace a card, you effectively, unbeknownst to you, can have any number of 'virtual card' tokens still floating around out in the world, held by the merchants who asked your bank for them, and those merchants can still use them to take money off you, regardless of whether the card details you originally gave them are still valid or not.

- ASB customer service workers have a standing instruction, when someone calls up to ask to cancel and replace a card, to manually go through and delete all of the 'virtual card tokens' linked to that customer's accounts in their system.

- However, if a customer just uses the 'cancel and replace card' feature in the ASB mobile app, there is no mention of these 'virtual card tokens', no mention that you need to call customer service to complete the cancellation process, and no automated deletion of any virtual card tokens. The tokens just stay there in ASB's system, and the merchants who created them can keep using them to charge you, until you call up ASB customer service and ask them to manually delete the tokens.

So, if you're an ASB customer, and you need to cancel and replace a debit or credit card, and you want to be sure that nobody who you gave the old card details to can still charge you through it: *you have to telephone customer support, you cannot rely on doing it via the mobile app*.

For non-ASB customers: If I were you, I'd call my bank and ask how this stuff is handled. Does your bank automatically delete all current virtual card tokens when the debit or credit card used to create them is cancelled?

And, if anyone senior at ASB is reading this: for god's sake, guys, start keeping a record of what card was used to create each virtual card token, and automatically invalidate the tokens when the card is invalidated! How did that not get designed in from the start? At the very least, update your mobile banking app's cancel-and-replace feature to pop up a warning that recurring charges might still be processed against the cancelled card unless the customer calls ASB's customer support line!

Editing to share a realization I had while engaging in the comments below:

This system behaviour, as disturbing as it is for us schmucks out there swiping our cards, benefits merchants by making it easier for them to take our money.

Merchants pay the transaction fees each time a card is swiped. So the *merchants* are the bank's customers for card products.

And so the banks are going to design their systems in whatever way makes the merchants happiest.

This will be why none of us have ever seen proactive advertising from our banks explaining how this system works.

Because if we all knew about it, if it was fully in the public eye, enough of us might be unhappy about it that it might be difficult for the banks to keep doing it. The banks might have to change to deleting tokens by default on card cancels, or maybe just ensuring that we're told about it and given a clear choice on what will happen. Imagine if the Banking Ombudsman decided that this was something that banks had a responsibility to ensure that customers were made fully aware of, instead of only mentioning it when customers asked about unexpected charges?",0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/14nn025/psa_i_learned_today_that_cancelling_and_replacing/,07/01/2023,10:50:15,jrandom_42,123,Europe

Visa,"Senior dev on a Visa, underpaid and fulfilling other roles","Senior dev on a Visa, underpaid and fulfilling other roles *My goal with this post is to bring visibility of what some companies do to their immigrants, how some of us can get stuck in the bureaucracy of US immigration laws and to get some love from peers during complex work statuses.*

Hi, 12 years of experience dev here, I currently live in the Austin, Texas, I got transferred here 4 years with an L1. Worked for the same company for 9 years and made my way as senior dev here. Joined them when it was a start up and now is a multi national company in public market (it got acquired).

After many years of back and forth with different company managers I accepted the Visa to be transferred here with the goal of get promoted as a tech lead or team manager. 4 years later that never happened. I asked multiple times what are they waiting for and the answer is that they are waiting for my green card to be approved (the company lawyers are working on it but they haven't filed it yet).

My reality now is that they are keeping me underpaid ($70K), asking for raise leads to the same answer as for my promotion. My engineering manager quit and I'm fulfilling that role as I'm the only senior dev in the team, and the company is not opening a new manager position.

I know that the easy answer is ""quit"", but in the case of my visa that means to get back to my country (which I don't want). I'm currently in the process of getting a green card on my own means but it takes time.

What things can I do to make this time until a get my green card a bit better?

Have you meet any other co workers in the same situation?

I was just thinking this guy most likely didn’t apply for a visa. I really think he didn’t apply for any type of visa. Then it had me thinking how can he be there without a visa?? From my understanding you would need some type of visa to stay in a country. He seems like he’s going to be doing nothing. Probably because Mary wouldn’t want him to work because there’s a chance he’ll work with women. From my experience I was thinking of going to South Korea with my boyfriend and I was going to teach English there. I would have needed a work visa for that. If Brandan was smart enough he should have went to the Philippines as an English teacher. It’s pretty easy to get a visa for that and it’s so high in demand. But I’m assuming he didn’t even think of that and Mary wouldn’t let him because of her jealously issues.

I’m just confused what is he going to do to stay there legally?? This couple is so confusing I have no words-",-0.8327,-0.8327,-0.8327,-0.8327,https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayFiance/comments/14xljxa/how_is_brandan_going_to_stay_in_the_philippines/,07/12/2023,16:13:12,moonxlight101,147,Europe

Visa,I got my Australian visa! What next?,"I got my Australian visa! What next? So ayun. After almost 5 years of waiting, processing documents, and more waiting. I finally have my permanent residence visa!

Anyway, I did my research and eto yung mga na -note ko na need ko gawin. Sa mga nakapag migrate na, pwede pakidagdagan kasi baka may importante pala akong nakalimutan. Haha

Before actually flying to Australia

1. Take the PDOS seminar para magkaron ng CFO sticker sa passport (kita ko may online seminar pero just wondering kung pano makukuha yung sticker kung online yung pinili?)
2. Secure enough funds for food, utilities, rent for first few months na wala pang work sa Australia (I actually plan na maghanap na ng work bago pa pumunta dun pero syempre para lang safe, plan ko magbudget kahit 3 mos worth)
3. Renew my PH drivers license (kasi sabi nila nacconvert daw to sa AU drivers license)
4. Talk to my PH banks to arrange yung mga OTP

Once I land in AU

1. Get an AU sim card
2. Open an AU bank account
3. Apply for Tax File Number, Centrelink Number, Medicare Number
4. Secure a rental property

Tapos, bilang galing tayo sa Pilipinas na sobrang tagal lagi anything related sa government, do you think mabilis lang makukuha yung mga nasa No. 3? Iniisip ko kasi mag airbnb muna ko sa 1st month ko pagdating AU habang wala pa kong nahahanap na rental property na long term. Kaso pano pag nagbago na ako ng address sa next month. Baka ipadala ung docs dun sa dati kong airbnb e nakalipat na ko sa ibang rental property? Or baka may iba kayong tips para dito?

Visa,"Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa","Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa I don't have other place to express my happiness then tell everyone on reddit. A little backstory we are not from USA. 

My brother (33M) is the worst scum of earth. I grew up in a chauvinist, cultish household where I had to behave so I didn't tarnish my family and no matter what happened my brother was the golden child. 

My brother would physically hurt my sisters and I, would make degrading comments like we were fat or ugly, critize our clothes, our cooking, our cleaning, yet he barely graduated HS. In the eyes of my parents he was not doing anything wrong, they would just tell him ""stop bothering your sisters"" and that was it. My brother grew up diminishing my sisters and I, I would cry in my room about the level of abuse.

My brother is a freeloader that hasn't work a single job in his life in our home country yet he went to USA to visit some relatives and decided to work on a tourist visa (as you know this is a HUGE no-no). From there on my brother thought of living in USA and never come back to my home country. 

Of course once the visa renewal came it was denied, my brother was heartbroken because obviously he has no work experience, single, has a Business degree (he graduated with the minimum requirements). He would tell my sisters and I to yive money monthly for house expenses and food, but I knew he was taking a portion to himself. 

He continued to be an a-hole but one day I decided to be the bigger person and open up to him, he stopped me and told me to my face ""I don't care about your life"". That was the moment I shut myself with him. And after years of abuse and discrimination for being a woman I found out he applied a second time for a visa and it was once again denied.

Error message on my ""Visa Application list"" that I was advised to ignore:
""An error occurred in process of inspection of the file. Upload a file again. passport number Pxxxxxxxx Name of the file null""
This error message was on my account from 30th May for about 3-4 days. But there was nothing I could do; no option to re-upload my passport, so I ignored it as advised by the consulate and customer hotline when I called them, respectively. 

Uploaded documents:
1. Passport photo (white background)
2. Passport copy (bio page and the following page) 
3. Emirates ID copy
4. Flight itinerary (already booked but pre-booking works as per requirements)
5. Bank statement last 3 months
6. Certificate of Employment (NOT NOC)
7. Schedule of Stay (use the form they provide on the website)
8. Hotel booking confirmation (pre-booking)
9. Residence visa copy (document to prove legal residency)

Notes: 
1. I uploaded all the above in pdf format, except for my passport photo. If you have more than one file per required document, you should upload in jpg or PNG format. 
However, even though I have 2 accommodations, I just merged them in 1 file and uploaded it in pdf like the rest.
 
2. Some required fields (like the hotel booking information) have limited character spaces, so if for example you have 2 accommodations, just write the contact number of the accommodation where you will stay the longest. As for the hotel name, try to write both. (What's more important is you write all your accommodation info on the Schedule of Stay form)

3. Schedule of Stay form. Just write ""Arrival to Japan via xx airport"" on your Day 0. I also added my accommodation info on Day 0 as this is the day I am moving there from the airport.

Visa,Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰,"Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰 Hi folks! I just want to let out a small rant. I'm from the UK and have been fortunate enough to spend a decent amount of time in Sydney. Between 2017-2018 I was here on a sponsored visa. I was promised by my employer that the move would be ""permanent"" so I invested quite heavily into ""settling down"" here. Only to learn 20 months later that my employer had botched my visa application and I suddenly found myself with 30 days to leave the country. I had an apartment filled with belongings, a girlfriend, and I had to abandon it all.

So back I was in the UK. It would take me another 3 years before I found a new Australian work sponsor, and another 4 years before I would actually arrive back here. That takes us to July 2022. I've been here (again) for a year now. And I have just been made redundant. I basically have 6 weeks to find a new sponsor before I have to leave everything behind again.

But I have always had to prepare for this possibility. I always knew it could happen. And that brings us back to the title of this post. Being here on a temporary visa without the security of being allowed to remain here is super stressful, because on the one hand, you want to try and build a life here, because ultimately I would like to get permanent residency, and I am living here full-time. But on the other hand, you have to be prepared to give it all up in a heartbeat. It means you cannot really let your guard down or really ever feel comfortable. You are always on edge.

It's been more than 6 years since I first had it in my head that I want to make Australia my home, I really do love it here compared to the UK. I'm in a fairly decent positive to make it happen, but it's still 50/50, and I could still be many years off making it happen.

That's about it really. I really just wanted to vent. I'm not complaining about the process or requesting any special treatment. Just wanted to express that life is good here, and there are many people (like me) who are sacrificing the best years of their lives just for a chance of being able to settle down here.

Visa,Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal,"Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal I booked my honeymoon package for greece and paid half of the amount (₹170000) in first week of April. Makemytrip visa team got in touch with me with list of documents to be submitted. I started preparing the required documents including bank statements, and affidavits from both of our parents as we were appearing for visa appointment before wedding. Got all the documents verified by the makemytrip visa team (Rubi was the POC). Me and my then fiancee (now wife) appeared for the visa appointment and submitted documents on April 21st. Total silence from GVCW (agency that takes documents for tourist visa and sends it to greek embassy for further processing) and the greek embassy. The next installment of payment to MMT was due on 30th may. I was really worried as there was no communication about visa processing, was really skeptical to pay the remaining half amount. Got in touch with my MakeMyTrip relationship manager (my poc for this booking) Ruchi and cried about this - that i didnt want to pay the rest as I am worried. She insisted I paid the full amount as visa will be processed - she said she knows people got greek visa recently who booked with MMT. I asked for extension if possible, she denied straight and asked me to pay or else she said the full booking would be cancelled. I paid as I was worried about loosing the already paid amount in case visa gets approved and bookings are cancelled. 
Approx around 17th of June, got my passport back with visa refusal letter with a reason: “The information submitted regarding the justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable”. The documents related to booking of flights and hotels were all provided by Makemytrip. All of these documents were verified by Makemytrip visa team. Still got this refusal.

I called the airline (Indigo) with the reason - they mentioned that booking can be cancelled and I can get around ₹90000 refund. Similarly I called all the hotels and they confirmed that they would refund the amount as the reason is genuine and they don’t have a problem to refund as this was almost 20days before the trip dates. All the other bookings were fully refundable as I checked the policies on individual products/service/experience websites. 
I got in touch with MMT visa team, they asked me to send the refusal letter over an email which I did. After that I got in touch with my RO (Ruchi) - she was copied in my email. After many attempts she picked up the call and said that okay I will process the cancellation - I told about the airline and hotel refunds - to which she said if that is the case I should have no problem getting my money back less some cancellation penalty. 

I got email from Indigo that booking has been cancelled and refund amount is approx ₹90000.

After this Ruchi stopped responding to my whatsapp messages and stopped picking up my calls. 

On July 14th Ruchi responds to my whatsapp ping and says there is no refund. 

I am feeling like I am scammed. MMT made me pay fully, they processed bookings, told me what documents to submit for visa - they got the refunds but I have to face big financial loss for no reason. I am not sure how I can even measure my mental trauma. This was supposed to be my honeymoon trip and it ends like this. How can makemytrip keep all this refund money?

I was curious to know how Pearl was able to move to the UK and spew her bullshit, since I'm also an immigrant to the UK and know for a fact there is no visa that allows her to do what she does. 

On twitter, she's said she moved here to play professional volleyball. You're only allowed to do VERY specific second jobs on a sports/work visa and sure as hell NOT allowed to start a 'business' and employ a team of editors etc. as Pearl has said.

Her name is not listed as a registered business owner in the UK. She is probably paying her 'team' under the table, not paying UK taxes, and if she's making more than ~$100,000, she's evading USA tax as well.

On twitter she's said she wants to move back to the USA, but damn, if the Home Office finds out what she's been probably doing here, her dumbass could perma banned from entering the UK and convicted of tax fraud in both the UK and USA.

Again, this is all **IN MY OPINION** but the fact that she's seemed to blow up very fast online tells me she did not have this all worked out with immigration and tax lawyers and is probably doing a lot of illegal shit under the radar.",-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/14bypfv/pear_is_100_violating_the_terms_of_her_visa_in/,06/17/2023,23:55:19,marius_ann,90,Europe

If you are applying for a visa around this time and you have a deadline you need to meet, then you should strongly consider paying for priority service. My personal suggestion:

* If you need to travel in less than 8 weeks, get priority service
* If you need to travel within 1-3 weeks, get super priority

There is NO point in calling/emailing the hotline (a 3rd party service staffed by Sitel UK, not UKVI) to escalate your visa decision because you don't have it quickly enough. We don't have any evidence that the call centre actually follows any protocol for escalation, and from what I've seen, they tell everyone they've ""escalated"" with no indication they've actually done so, unless the case is exceptional. The hotline is intended to take your money and fob you off.

Realistically, you should be prepared to pay for a faster service if you have to be in the UK at a certain time. Please remember to apply as early in advance as possible (usually 3 months for most visas).",0.816,0.816,0.816,0.816,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1598ega/reminder_student_visa_season_affects_all_visa/,07/25/2023,18:21:30,clever_octopus,26,Europe

Visa,AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”?,"AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”? Context: My mum is Thai, and my dad is Dutch. I grew up in Thailand.  My mum married again and I have a stepsister who is 3 years older than me. 

My stepsister always brings up stuff like “you have no idea how hard travelling is for us because you have a strong passport” whenever she’s feeling stressed about travelling. 

My family (me, mum, stepsister, stepdad), are currently planning a trip to Germany. They’re in the process of applying for a Schengen visa. I think seeing me relaxing and unstressed about the whole thing grated on my sister because I’m just chilling while they’re running around getting flight tickets, proof of accommodation, statement of purpose, bank statements, travel health insurance, money for the visa fee and a bunch more stuff. 

She finally snapped and was like “aren’t you even going to try to be helpful? At least share the visa fee with us”. I said no. I am financially contributing the same amount she is to the trip, the visa fee is just an added expense she has that I don’t. 

She was unhappy because “I just don’t get it” and kept telling me things would only be “fair” if I agreed to share that cost, at least.  She’s been giving me the cold shoulder since because she thinks I’m a bit of an ass. 

My mum would like me to apologise to her and agree to share the cost at which point she would then reimburse me just to keep the peace.",0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s7n71/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_the_cost_of_my/,07/06/2023,17:24:09,PersonalStation7321,554,Africa
Visa,Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays.,"Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays. My wife is non-European origin and visibly Muslim. She had an itinerary as follows MTL to London Heatherow to Istanbul international with the Airline and then her flight to her country with a separate airline. We live in Ontario - this post is on-going she is currently detained in Germany! A country she was never even supposed to be in.

Her first flight was delayed and she along with 100 others or so missed their connecting flights. After waiting in line for 2.5 hrs in London she was given a new ticket and told to run to the gate so she might make it to Istanbul on time. The new flight routed her through a small German airport that didn't have an international transit area. 

My wife gets off the plane runs towards her next gate because the flights were really close and when she gets to passport control 
 she is detained by Germain passport control for not having a German visa ( doesn't have a Canadian passport yet). 
She is given a criminal offense- unlawful entry, is humiliated in public by being escorted by police. She is searched and held in a holding area  until a flight out can be arranged. This is her second international trip the first was to Canada. She was balling and crying for hours, 20 hrs in her voice is still shaking when she talks to me.

 This was a direct assault on our dignity and she was treated like a criminal and detained for what will be about 24 hrs by the time shes escorted to her flight to Istanbul ( new flight). 

Airline did nothing to help. I called several times, they ran us around and finally suggested I need to buy new ticket to get her to Istanbul or Canada.
 They dumped her in the wrong country then tell us we have to spend more money to get her to the destination all because she was detained due to their negligence.  I'm livid. Sorry for the inconvenience they say. Apparently getting arrested in a foreign country you had no intention of visiting and then being banned from entry for life is an inconvenience.  

She is traumatized and still in detention her flight out is in a few hours and needless to say her final flight had to also be repurchased..I want to sue the Airline all legal advice is appreciated.

Her new flight is with another airline. The last I heard from the first airline is "" they are trying to get in touch with German authorities"". Not once did they call her...",-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/151nte9/airline_got_my_wife_detained_by_routing_her/,07/17/2023,06:25:58,talktomesexytimes,265,Africa

Visa,Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland,"Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland Liebe Gewerbetreibende,

ich bin gerade mal wieder im Urlaub... Letztes Mal in Schweden, dieses Mal in Frankreich. Was mir mal wieder massiv auffällt: ich konnte in Schweden bei der kleinsten Eisbude im Hinterland mit VISA zahlen und hier in Frankreich ist es das Selbe: ich kann an jeder noch so kleinen Bumsbude mit der VISA zahlen. Kein Problem!

Warum verflucht nochmal bekommen es andere EU Länder hin selbst bei Pommesbuden VISA Karte als Zahlungsmittel zu haben und wir in Deutschland können nicht mal in Touristenorten in allen Geschäften mit VISA Zahlen. In der Eisdiele erwarte ich es ja nicht mal - obwohl auch das kein Problem zu sein scheint - aber verflucht nochmal warum in Geschäften nicht?

Ich bin mittlerweile an einem Punkt angekommen an dem ich ein Geschäft wieder verlasse wenn keine Visa akzeptiert wird. Dann macht den Umsatz eben ein Anderer. Die Höhe war vor dem Urlaub meine Werkstatt: beim Bezahlen mit der Visa fragt mich der Werkstattmeister (und Eigentümer), ob ich nicht eine andere Karte dabei habe, bei VISA bekommt er nicht den vollen Betrag... Weil ihm das bei den Apothekenpreisen seiner Leistungen auch das Bein bricht wenn ~1,2% Gebühren weg gehen. War das letzte Mal, dass ich mein Auto bei ihm abgegeben habe, das hab ich ihm auch gesagt. Finde das unverschämt, Geld verdienen wollen aber nichts dafür ausgeben wollen.

Liebe Gewerbetreibende! Rafft euch mal. Bietet VISA an und geht mit der Zeit. Es kann nicht sein, dass wir in Deutschland bei den Zahlungsmitteln auf dem Stand der 90er stehen bleiben, nur weil ihr 1,2% mehr Gewinn machen könntet. Falls ihr wegen den 1,2% nicht mehr profitabel seid sperrts den Laden bitte zu... Dann habt ihr eh ein Problem. Kommt mal im Jahr 2023 an... Bitte! Danke!

What do you think I can do legally? I am 100% sure now that he used me for visa and showed his true colors after his arrival. As he refused to divorce, we strated a trial but it won't move forward until the end of the year.

Visa,Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore.,"Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore. Background: 

I arrived in Thailand July 2021 and stayed with COVID extensions until October 2022. After that, I arranged an education visa that went into effect January 2023 and expires January 2024. 

I never broke the law in Thailand or had any other issues with the authorities here. 

However, despite doing everything by the book and securing a reentry permit before leaving Thailand, and despite being cleared at the airport and allowed to enter Thailand through Phuket, Thai immigration just denied my education visa renewal after I made my appointment with them this morning. 

Their reasoning is that I travelled on the education visa too frequently.

These were my trips:

1) One trip to Israel in March 2023 to help my dad with health issues. 

2) One trip to Dubai in May 2023 for only 3 days. 

3) Another trip to Israel after my dad recently suffered a stroke and almost died in July 2023. 

The immigration officer didn't care about my story, either. I was just another number to them. 

Sometimes life throws you punches. Not only did I almost just lose my dad this month, but I just lost my home in Thailand. But it's OK. Everything happens for a reason, and I planned on returning to Israel very shortly as it is to continue taking care of my dad. I'm just posting this as a warning to others: do not rely on education visas any longer. Thai authorities are cracking down on them, and they are not a good way to live in Thailand long term if you need to travel.

Visa,PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you!,"PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you! This situation is ASB-specific, but it seems possible to me that other banks might be affected too. If you bank with ASB, you need to know this, and if you don't, it's probably still a good idea for you to call your bank and ask how they handle it.

The story goes: A week ago, I used the ASB mobile app's 'cancel and replace card' feature. I had loaded my ASB VISA debit card details into a family member's Uber account, and in an abundance of caution, once that was no longer needed, I figured I should cancel and replace the card. It doesn't hurt to do that every year or two regardless, as a general security principle, right?

So I did the 'cancel and replace' thing in the app.

It's a week later now, and I still haven't received the new card in the mail, but that's just because NZ Post is shit. Anyway, I'm idly reviewing my bank transactions today, as you do, and I see that my monthly Playstation Network subscription has been successfully charged to my ASB account. Now, I'd forgotten about that PSN subscription that I'd set up on the now-cancelled card. All PSN had was my old ASB debit VISA card details. I should've received an email from PSN complaining about a failed payment. Yet they're still successfully charging me!

So I called ASB customer service, and had an interesting conversation with a very nice lady, who explained:

- There is a feature offered by VISA and MasterCard where a merchant who is going to process recurring card transactions can get a 'secure token' to charge, instead of using the actual card details themselves. (This seems like a good security feature to me - the customer support lady wasn't really familiar with how it worked, but I assume the token can only be used to initiate charges by the merchant it was issued to, meaning that if the merchant's stored payment data is stolen, nobody can use the info to make fraudulent card transactions. Good design, props to VISA and MasterCard.)

- These 'chargeable secure tokens' are created by the card-issuing bank, when a merchant provides a customer's card details and requests a token.

- In ASB's case, it seems that the tokens are linked *to your bank account*, as if they were entirely separate debit cards, not *to the card itself*. So, when you cancel and replace a card, you effectively, unbeknownst to you, can have any number of 'virtual card' tokens still floating around out in the world, held by the merchants who asked your bank for them, and those merchants can still use them to take money off you, regardless of whether the card details you originally gave them are still valid or not.

- ASB customer service workers have a standing instruction, when someone calls up to ask to cancel and replace a card, to manually go through and delete all of the 'virtual card tokens' linked to that customer's accounts in their system.

- However, if a customer just uses the 'cancel and replace card' feature in the ASB mobile app, there is no mention of these 'virtual card tokens', no mention that you need to call customer service to complete the cancellation process, and no automated deletion of any virtual card tokens. The tokens just stay there in ASB's system, and the merchants who created them can keep using them to charge you, until you call up ASB customer service and ask them to manually delete the tokens.

So, if you're an ASB customer, and you need to cancel and replace a debit or credit card, and you want to be sure that nobody who you gave the old card details to can still charge you through it: *you have to telephone customer support, you cannot rely on doing it via the mobile app*.

For non-ASB customers: If I were you, I'd call my bank and ask how this stuff is handled. Does your bank automatically delete all current virtual card tokens when the debit or credit card used to create them is cancelled?

And, if anyone senior at ASB is reading this: for god's sake, guys, start keeping a record of what card was used to create each virtual card token, and automatically invalidate the tokens when the card is invalidated! How did that not get designed in from the start? At the very least, update your mobile banking app's cancel-and-replace feature to pop up a warning that recurring charges might still be processed against the cancelled card unless the customer calls ASB's customer support line!

Editing to share a realization I had while engaging in the comments below:

This system behaviour, as disturbing as it is for us schmucks out there swiping our cards, benefits merchants by making it easier for them to take our money.

Merchants pay the transaction fees each time a card is swiped. So the *merchants* are the bank's customers for card products.

And so the banks are going to design their systems in whatever way makes the merchants happiest.

This will be why none of us have ever seen proactive advertising from our banks explaining how this system works.

Because if we all knew about it, if it was fully in the public eye, enough of us might be unhappy about it that it might be difficult for the banks to keep doing it. The banks might have to change to deleting tokens by default on card cancels, or maybe just ensuring that we're told about it and given a clear choice on what will happen. Imagine if the Banking Ombudsman decided that this was something that banks had a responsibility to ensure that customers were made fully aware of, instead of only mentioning it when customers asked about unexpected charges?",0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/14nn025/psa_i_learned_today_that_cancelling_and_replacing/,07/01/2023,10:50:15,jrandom_42,123,Africa

Visa,"Senior dev on a Visa, underpaid and fulfilling other roles","Senior dev on a Visa, underpaid and fulfilling other roles *My goal with this post is to bring visibility of what some companies do to their immigrants, how some of us can get stuck in the bureaucracy of US immigration laws and to get some love from peers during complex work statuses.*

Hi, 12 years of experience dev here, I currently live in the Austin, Texas, I got transferred here 4 years with an L1. Worked for the same company for 9 years and made my way as senior dev here. Joined them when it was a start up and now is a multi national company in public market (it got acquired).

After many years of back and forth with different company managers I accepted the Visa to be transferred here with the goal of get promoted as a tech lead or team manager. 4 years later that never happened. I asked multiple times what are they waiting for and the answer is that they are waiting for my green card to be approved (the company lawyers are working on it but they haven't filed it yet).

My reality now is that they are keeping me underpaid ($70K), asking for raise leads to the same answer as for my promotion. My engineering manager quit and I'm fulfilling that role as I'm the only senior dev in the team, and the company is not opening a new manager position.

I know that the easy answer is ""quit"", but in the case of my visa that means to get back to my country (which I don't want). I'm currently in the process of getting a green card on my own means but it takes time.

What things can I do to make this time until a get my green card a bit better?

Have you meet any other co workers in the same situation?

I was just thinking this guy most likely didn’t apply for a visa. I really think he didn’t apply for any type of visa. Then it had me thinking how can he be there without a visa?? From my understanding you would need some type of visa to stay in a country. He seems like he’s going to be doing nothing. Probably because Mary wouldn’t want him to work because there’s a chance he’ll work with women. From my experience I was thinking of going to South Korea with my boyfriend and I was going to teach English there. I would have needed a work visa for that. If Brandan was smart enough he should have went to the Philippines as an English teacher. It’s pretty easy to get a visa for that and it’s so high in demand. But I’m assuming he didn’t even think of that and Mary wouldn’t let him because of her jealously issues.

I’m just confused what is he going to do to stay there legally?? This couple is so confusing I have no words-",-0.8327,-0.8327,-0.8327,-0.8327,https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayFiance/comments/14xljxa/how_is_brandan_going_to_stay_in_the_philippines/,07/12/2023,16:13:12,moonxlight101,147,Africa

Visa,I got my Australian visa! What next?,"I got my Australian visa! What next? So ayun. After almost 5 years of waiting, processing documents, and more waiting. I finally have my permanent residence visa!

Anyway, I did my research and eto yung mga na -note ko na need ko gawin. Sa mga nakapag migrate na, pwede pakidagdagan kasi baka may importante pala akong nakalimutan. Haha

Before actually flying to Australia

1. Take the PDOS seminar para magkaron ng CFO sticker sa passport (kita ko may online seminar pero just wondering kung pano makukuha yung sticker kung online yung pinili?)
2. Secure enough funds for food, utilities, rent for first few months na wala pang work sa Australia (I actually plan na maghanap na ng work bago pa pumunta dun pero syempre para lang safe, plan ko magbudget kahit 3 mos worth)
3. Renew my PH drivers license (kasi sabi nila nacconvert daw to sa AU drivers license)
4. Talk to my PH banks to arrange yung mga OTP

Once I land in AU

1. Get an AU sim card
2. Open an AU bank account
3. Apply for Tax File Number, Centrelink Number, Medicare Number
4. Secure a rental property

Tapos, bilang galing tayo sa Pilipinas na sobrang tagal lagi anything related sa government, do you think mabilis lang makukuha yung mga nasa No. 3? Iniisip ko kasi mag airbnb muna ko sa 1st month ko pagdating AU habang wala pa kong nahahanap na rental property na long term. Kaso pano pag nagbago na ako ng address sa next month. Baka ipadala ung docs dun sa dati kong airbnb e nakalipat na ko sa ibang rental property? Or baka may iba kayong tips para dito? Wala kasi talaga ako kakilala don sa AU so pakikitira is not an option :(",0.9239,0.9239,0.9239,0.9239,https://www.reddit.com/r/phmigrate/comments/1577z9d/i_got_my_australian_visa_what_next/,07/23/2023,12:18:41,dreambigdreams01,72,Africa

Visa,"Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa","Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa I don't have other place to express my happiness then tell everyone on reddit. A little backstory we are not from USA. 

My brother (33M) is the worst scum of earth. I grew up in a chauvinist, cultish household where I had to behave so I didn't tarnish my family and no matter what happened my brother was the golden child. 

My brother would physically hurt my sisters and I, would make degrading comments like we were fat or ugly, critize our clothes, our cooking, our cleaning, yet he barely graduated HS. In the eyes of my parents he was not doing anything wrong, they would just tell him ""stop bothering your sisters"" and that was it. My brother grew up diminishing my sisters and I, I would cry in my room about the level of abuse.

My brother is a freeloader that hasn't work a single job in his life in our home country yet he went to USA to visit some relatives and decided to work on a tourist visa (as you know this is a HUGE no-no). From there on my brother thought of living in USA and never come back to my home country. 

Of course once the visa renewal came it was denied, my brother was heartbroken because obviously he has no work experience, single, has a Business degree (he graduated with the minimum requirements). He would tell my sisters and I to yive money monthly for house expenses and food, but I knew he was taking a portion to himself. 

He continued to be an a-hole but one day I decided to be the bigger person and open up to him, he stopped me and told me to my face ""I don't care about your life"". That was the moment I shut myself with him. And after years of abuse and discrimination for being a woman I found out he applied a second time for a visa and it was once again denied.

Error message on my ""Visa Application list"" that I was advised to ignore:
""An error occurred in process of inspection of the file. Upload a file again. passport number Pxxxxxxxx Name of the file null""
This error message was on my account from 30th May for about 3-4 days. But there was nothing I could do; no option to re-upload my passport, so I ignored it as advised by the consulate and customer hotline when I called them, respectively. 

Uploaded documents:
1. Passport photo (white background)
2. Passport copy (bio page and the following page) 
3. Emirates ID copy
4. Flight itinerary (already booked but pre-booking works as per requirements)
5. Bank statement last 3 months
6. Certificate of Employment (NOT NOC)
7. Schedule of Stay (use the form they provide on the website)
8. Hotel booking confirmation (pre-booking)
9. Residence visa copy (document to prove legal residency)

Notes: 
1. I uploaded all the above in pdf format, except for my passport photo. If you have more than one file per required document, you should upload in jpg or PNG format. 
However, even though I have 2 accommodations, I just merged them in 1 file and uploaded it in pdf like the rest.
 
2. Some required fields (like the hotel booking information) have limited character spaces, so if for example you have 2 accommodations, just write the contact number of the accommodation where you will stay the longest. As for the hotel name, try to write both. (What's more important is you write all your accommodation info on the Schedule of Stay form)

3. Schedule of Stay form. Just write ""Arrival to Japan via xx airport"" on your Day 0. I also added my accommodation info on Day 0 as this is the day I am moving there from the airport.

Visa,Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰,"Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰 Hi folks! I just want to let out a small rant. I'm from the UK and have been fortunate enough to spend a decent amount of time in Sydney. Between 2017-2018 I was here on a sponsored visa. I was promised by my employer that the move would be ""permanent"" so I invested quite heavily into ""settling down"" here. Only to learn 20 months later that my employer had botched my visa application and I suddenly found myself with 30 days to leave the country. I had an apartment filled with belongings, a girlfriend, and I had to abandon it all.

So back I was in the UK. It would take me another 3 years before I found a new Australian work sponsor, and another 4 years before I would actually arrive back here. That takes us to July 2022. I've been here (again) for a year now. And I have just been made redundant. I basically have 6 weeks to find a new sponsor before I have to leave everything behind again.

But I have always had to prepare for this possibility. I always knew it could happen. And that brings us back to the title of this post. Being here on a temporary visa without the security of being allowed to remain here is super stressful, because on the one hand, you want to try and build a life here, because ultimately I would like to get permanent residency, and I am living here full-time. But on the other hand, you have to be prepared to give it all up in a heartbeat. It means you cannot really let your guard down or really ever feel comfortable. You are always on edge.

It's been more than 6 years since I first had it in my head that I want to make Australia my home, I really do love it here compared to the UK. I'm in a fairly decent positive to make it happen, but it's still 50/50, and I could still be many years off making it happen.

That's about it really. I really just wanted to vent. I'm not complaining about the process or requesting any special treatment. Just wanted to express that life is good here, and there are many people (like me) who are sacrificing the best years of their lives just for a chance of being able to settle down here.

Visa,Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal,"Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal I booked my honeymoon package for greece and paid half of the amount (₹170000) in first week of April. Makemytrip visa team got in touch with me with list of documents to be submitted. I started preparing the required documents including bank statements, and affidavits from both of our parents as we were appearing for visa appointment before wedding. Got all the documents verified by the makemytrip visa team (Rubi was the POC). Me and my then fiancee (now wife) appeared for the visa appointment and submitted documents on April 21st. Total silence from GVCW (agency that takes documents for tourist visa and sends it to greek embassy for further processing) and the greek embassy. The next installment of payment to MMT was due on 30th may. I was really worried as there was no communication about visa processing, was really skeptical to pay the remaining half amount. Got in touch with my MakeMyTrip relationship manager (my poc for this booking) Ruchi and cried about this - that i didnt want to pay the rest as I am worried. She insisted I paid the full amount as visa will be processed - she said she knows people got greek visa recently who booked with MMT. I asked for extension if possible, she denied straight and asked me to pay or else she said the full booking would be cancelled. I paid as I was worried about loosing the already paid amount in case visa gets approved and bookings are cancelled. 
Approx around 17th of June, got my passport back with visa refusal letter with a reason: “The information submitted regarding the justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable”. The documents related to booking of flights and hotels were all provided by Makemytrip. All of these documents were verified by Makemytrip visa team. Still got this refusal.

I called the airline (Indigo) with the reason - they mentioned that booking can be cancelled and I can get around ₹90000 refund. Similarly I called all the hotels and they confirmed that they would refund the amount as the reason is genuine and they don’t have a problem to refund as this was almost 20days before the trip dates. All the other bookings were fully refundable as I checked the policies on individual products/service/experience websites. 
I got in touch with MMT visa team, they asked me to send the refusal letter over an email which I did. After that I got in touch with my RO (Ruchi) - she was copied in my email. After many attempts she picked up the call and said that okay I will process the cancellation - I told about the airline and hotel refunds - to which she said if that is the case I should have no problem getting my money back less some cancellation penalty. 

I got email from Indigo that booking has been cancelled and refund amount is approx ₹90000.

After this Ruchi stopped responding to my whatsapp messages and stopped picking up my calls. 

On July 14th Ruchi responds to my whatsapp ping and says there is no refund. 

I am feeling like I am scammed. MMT made me pay fully, they processed bookings, told me what documents to submit for visa - they got the refunds but I have to face big financial loss for no reason. I am not sure how I can even measure my mental trauma. This was supposed to be my honeymoon trip and it ends like this. How can makemytrip keep all this refund money?

I was curious to know how Pearl was able to move to the UK and spew her bullshit, since I'm also an immigrant to the UK and know for a fact there is no visa that allows her to do what she does. 

On twitter, she's said she moved here to play professional volleyball. You're only allowed to do VERY specific second jobs on a sports/work visa and sure as hell NOT allowed to start a 'business' and employ a team of editors etc. as Pearl has said.

Her name is not listed as a registered business owner in the UK. She is probably paying her 'team' under the table, not paying UK taxes, and if she's making more than ~$100,000, she's evading USA tax as well.

On twitter she's said she wants to move back to the USA, but damn, if the Home Office finds out what she's been probably doing here, her dumbass could perma banned from entering the UK and convicted of tax fraud in both the UK and USA.

Again, this is all **IN MY OPINION** but the fact that she's seemed to blow up very fast online tells me she did not have this all worked out with immigration and tax lawyers and is probably doing a lot of illegal shit under the radar.",-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/14bypfv/pear_is_100_violating_the_terms_of_her_visa_in/,06/17/2023,23:55:19,marius_ann,90,Africa

If you are applying for a visa around this time and you have a deadline you need to meet, then you should strongly consider paying for priority service. My personal suggestion:

* If you need to travel in less than 8 weeks, get priority service
* If you need to travel within 1-3 weeks, get super priority

There is NO point in calling/emailing the hotline (a 3rd party service staffed by Sitel UK, not UKVI) to escalate your visa decision because you don't have it quickly enough. We don't have any evidence that the call centre actually follows any protocol for escalation, and from what I've seen, they tell everyone they've ""escalated"" with no indication they've actually done so, unless the case is exceptional. The hotline is intended to take your money and fob you off.

Realistically, you should be prepared to pay for a faster service if you have to be in the UK at a certain time. Please remember to apply as early in advance as possible (usually 3 months for most visas).",0.816,0.816,0.816,0.816,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1598ega/reminder_student_visa_season_affects_all_visa/,07/25/2023,18:21:30,clever_octopus,26,Africa

Visa,AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”?,"AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”? Context: My mum is Thai, and my dad is Dutch. I grew up in Thailand.  My mum married again and I have a stepsister who is 3 years older than me. 

My stepsister always brings up stuff like “you have no idea how hard travelling is for us because you have a strong passport” whenever she’s feeling stressed about travelling. 

My family (me, mum, stepsister, stepdad), are currently planning a trip to Germany. They’re in the process of applying for a Schengen visa. I think seeing me relaxing and unstressed about the whole thing grated on my sister because I’m just chilling while they’re running around getting flight tickets, proof of accommodation, statement of purpose, bank statements, travel health insurance, money for the visa fee and a bunch more stuff. 

She finally snapped and was like “aren’t you even going to try to be helpful? At least share the visa fee with us”. I said no. I am financially contributing the same amount she is to the trip, the visa fee is just an added expense she has that I don’t. 

She was unhappy because “I just don’t get it” and kept telling me things would only be “fair” if I agreed to share that cost, at least.  She’s been giving me the cold shoulder since because she thinks I’m a bit of an ass. 

My mum would like me to apologise to her and agree to share the cost at which point she would then reimburse me just to keep the peace.",0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s7n71/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_the_cost_of_my/,07/06/2023,17:24:09,PersonalStation7321,554,Asia
Visa,Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays.,"Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays. My wife is non-European origin and visibly Muslim. She had an itinerary as follows MTL to London Heatherow to Istanbul international with the Airline and then her flight to her country with a separate airline. We live in Ontario - this post is on-going she is currently detained in Germany! A country she was never even supposed to be in.

Her first flight was delayed and she along with 100 others or so missed their connecting flights. After waiting in line for 2.5 hrs in London she was given a new ticket and told to run to the gate so she might make it to Istanbul on time. The new flight routed her through a small German airport that didn't have an international transit area. 

My wife gets off the plane runs towards her next gate because the flights were really close and when she gets to passport control 
 she is detained by Germain passport control for not having a German visa ( doesn't have a Canadian passport yet). 
She is given a criminal offense- unlawful entry, is humiliated in public by being escorted by police. She is searched and held in a holding area  until a flight out can be arranged. This is her second international trip the first was to Canada. She was balling and crying for hours, 20 hrs in her voice is still shaking when she talks to me.

 This was a direct assault on our dignity and she was treated like a criminal and detained for what will be about 24 hrs by the time shes escorted to her flight to Istanbul ( new flight). 

Airline did nothing to help. I called several times, they ran us around and finally suggested I need to buy new ticket to get her to Istanbul or Canada.
 They dumped her in the wrong country then tell us we have to spend more money to get her to the destination all because she was detained due to their negligence.  I'm livid. Sorry for the inconvenience they say. Apparently getting arrested in a foreign country you had no intention of visiting and then being banned from entry for life is an inconvenience.  

She is traumatized and still in detention her flight out is in a few hours and needless to say her final flight had to also be repurchased..I want to sue the Airline all legal advice is appreciated.

Her new flight is with another airline. The last I heard from the first airline is "" they are trying to get in touch with German authorities"". Not once did they call her...",-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/151nte9/airline_got_my_wife_detained_by_routing_her/,07/17/2023,06:25:58,talktomesexytimes,265,Asia

Visa,Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland,"Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland Liebe Gewerbetreibende,

ich bin gerade mal wieder im Urlaub... Letztes Mal in Schweden, dieses Mal in Frankreich. Was mir mal wieder massiv auffällt: ich konnte in Schweden bei der kleinsten Eisbude im Hinterland mit VISA zahlen und hier in Frankreich ist es das Selbe: ich kann an jeder noch so kleinen Bumsbude mit der VISA zahlen. Kein Problem!

Warum verflucht nochmal bekommen es andere EU Länder hin selbst bei Pommesbuden VISA Karte als Zahlungsmittel zu haben und wir in Deutschland können nicht mal in Touristenorten in allen Geschäften mit VISA Zahlen. In der Eisdiele erwarte ich es ja nicht mal - obwohl auch das kein Problem zu sein scheint - aber verflucht nochmal warum in Geschäften nicht?

Ich bin mittlerweile an einem Punkt angekommen an dem ich ein Geschäft wieder verlasse wenn keine Visa akzeptiert wird. Dann macht den Umsatz eben ein Anderer. Die Höhe war vor dem Urlaub meine Werkstatt: beim Bezahlen mit der Visa fragt mich der Werkstattmeister (und Eigentümer), ob ich nicht eine andere Karte dabei habe, bei VISA bekommt er nicht den vollen Betrag... Weil ihm das bei den Apothekenpreisen seiner Leistungen auch das Bein bricht wenn ~1,2% Gebühren weg gehen. War das letzte Mal, dass ich mein Auto bei ihm abgegeben habe, das hab ich ihm auch gesagt. Finde das unverschämt, Geld verdienen wollen aber nichts dafür ausgeben wollen.

Liebe Gewerbetreibende! Rafft euch mal. Bietet VISA an und geht mit der Zeit. Es kann nicht sein, dass wir in Deutschland bei den Zahlungsmitteln auf dem Stand der 90er stehen bleiben, nur weil ihr 1,2% mehr Gewinn machen könntet. Falls ihr wegen den 1,2% nicht mehr profitabel seid sperrts den Laden bitte zu... Dann habt ihr eh ein Problem. Kommt mal im Jahr 2023 an... Bitte! Danke!

What do you think I can do legally? I am 100% sure now that he used me for visa and showed his true colors after his arrival. As he refused to divorce, we strated a trial but it won't move forward until the end of the year.

Visa,Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore.,"Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore. Background: 

I arrived in Thailand July 2021 and stayed with COVID extensions until October 2022. After that, I arranged an education visa that went into effect January 2023 and expires January 2024. 

I never broke the law in Thailand or had any other issues with the authorities here. 

However, despite doing everything by the book and securing a reentry permit before leaving Thailand, and despite being cleared at the airport and allowed to enter Thailand through Phuket, Thai immigration just denied my education visa renewal after I made my appointment with them this morning. 

Their reasoning is that I travelled on the education visa too frequently.

These were my trips:

1) One trip to Israel in March 2023 to help my dad with health issues. 

2) One trip to Dubai in May 2023 for only 3 days. 

3) Another trip to Israel after my dad recently suffered a stroke and almost died in July 2023. 

The immigration officer didn't care about my story, either. I was just another number to them. 

Sometimes life throws you punches. Not only did I almost just lose my dad this month, but I just lost my home in Thailand. But it's OK. Everything happens for a reason, and I planned on returning to Israel very shortly as it is to continue taking care of my dad. I'm just posting this as a warning to others: do not rely on education visas any longer. Thai authorities are cracking down on them, and they are not a good way to live in Thailand long term if you need to travel.

Visa,PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you!,"PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you! This situation is ASB-specific, but it seems possible to me that other banks might be affected too. If you bank with ASB, you need to know this, and if you don't, it's probably still a good idea for you to call your bank and ask how they handle it.

The story goes: A week ago, I used the ASB mobile app's 'cancel and replace card' feature. I had loaded my ASB VISA debit card details into a family member's Uber account, and in an abundance of caution, once that was no longer needed, I figured I should cancel and replace the card. It doesn't hurt to do that every year or two regardless, as a general security principle, right?

So I did the 'cancel and replace' thing in the app.

It's a week later now, and I still haven't received the new card in the mail, but that's just because NZ Post is shit. Anyway, I'm idly reviewing my bank transactions today, as you do, and I see that my monthly Playstation Network subscription has been successfully charged to my ASB account. Now, I'd forgotten about that PSN subscription that I'd set up on the now-cancelled card. All PSN had was my old ASB debit VISA card details. I should've received an email from PSN complaining about a failed payment. Yet they're still successfully charging me!

So I called ASB customer service, and had an interesting conversation with a very nice lady, who explained:

- There is a feature offered by VISA and MasterCard where a merchant who is going to process recurring card transactions can get a 'secure token' to charge, instead of using the actual card details themselves. (This seems like a good security feature to me - the customer support lady wasn't really familiar with how it worked, but I assume the token can only be used to initiate charges by the merchant it was issued to, meaning that if the merchant's stored payment data is stolen, nobody can use the info to make fraudulent card transactions. Good design, props to VISA and MasterCard.)

- These 'chargeable secure tokens' are created by the card-issuing bank, when a merchant provides a customer's card details and requests a token.

- In ASB's case, it seems that the tokens are linked *to your bank account*, as if they were entirely separate debit cards, not *to the card itself*. So, when you cancel and replace a card, you effectively, unbeknownst to you, can have any number of 'virtual card' tokens still floating around out in the world, held by the merchants who asked your bank for them, and those merchants can still use them to take money off you, regardless of whether the card details you originally gave them are still valid or not.

- ASB customer service workers have a standing instruction, when someone calls up to ask to cancel and replace a card, to manually go through and delete all of the 'virtual card tokens' linked to that customer's accounts in their system.

- However, if a customer just uses the 'cancel and replace card' feature in the ASB mobile app, there is no mention of these 'virtual card tokens', no mention that you need to call customer service to complete the cancellation process, and no automated deletion of any virtual card tokens. The tokens just stay there in ASB's system, and the merchants who created them can keep using them to charge you, until you call up ASB customer service and ask them to manually delete the tokens.

So, if you're an ASB customer, and you need to cancel and replace a debit or credit card, and you want to be sure that nobody who you gave the old card details to can still charge you through it: *you have to telephone customer support, you cannot rely on doing it via the mobile app*.

For non-ASB customers: If I were you, I'd call my bank and ask how this stuff is handled. Does your bank automatically delete all current virtual card tokens when the debit or credit card used to create them is cancelled?

And, if anyone senior at ASB is reading this: for god's sake, guys, start keeping a record of what card was used to create each virtual card token, and automatically invalidate the tokens when the card is invalidated! How did that not get designed in from the start? At the very least, update your mobile banking app's cancel-and-replace feature to pop up a warning that recurring charges might still be processed against the cancelled card unless the customer calls ASB's customer support line!

Editing to share a realization I had while engaging in the comments below:

This system behaviour, as disturbing as it is for us schmucks out there swiping our cards, benefits merchants by making it easier for them to take our money.

Merchants pay the transaction fees each time a card is swiped. So the *merchants* are the bank's customers for card products.

And so the banks are going to design their systems in whatever way makes the merchants happiest.

This will be why none of us have ever seen proactive advertising from our banks explaining how this system works.

Because if we all knew about it, if it was fully in the public eye, enough of us might be unhappy about it that it might be difficult for the banks to keep doing it. The banks might have to change to deleting tokens by default on card cancels, or maybe just ensuring that we're told about it and given a clear choice on what will happen. Imagine if the Banking Ombudsman decided that this was something that banks had a responsibility to ensure that customers were made fully aware of, instead of only mentioning it when customers asked about unexpected charges?",0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/14nn025/psa_i_learned_today_that_cancelling_and_replacing/,07/01/2023,10:50:15,jrandom_42,123,Asia

Visa,"Senior dev on a Visa, underpaid and fulfilling other roles","Senior dev on a Visa, underpaid and fulfilling other roles *My goal with this post is to bring visibility of what some companies do to their immigrants, how some of us can get stuck in the bureaucracy of US immigration laws and to get some love from peers during complex work statuses.*

Hi, 12 years of experience dev here, I currently live in the Austin, Texas, I got transferred here 4 years with an L1. Worked for the same company for 9 years and made my way as senior dev here. Joined them when it was a start up and now is a multi national company in public market (it got acquired).

After many years of back and forth with different company managers I accepted the Visa to be transferred here with the goal of get promoted as a tech lead or team manager. 4 years later that never happened. I asked multiple times what are they waiting for and the answer is that they are waiting for my green card to be approved (the company lawyers are working on it but they haven't filed it yet).

My reality now is that they are keeping me underpaid ($70K), asking for raise leads to the same answer as for my promotion. My engineering manager quit and I'm fulfilling that role as I'm the only senior dev in the team, and the company is not opening a new manager position.

I know that the easy answer is ""quit"", but in the case of my visa that means to get back to my country (which I don't want). I'm currently in the process of getting a green card on my own means but it takes time.

What things can I do to make this time until a get my green card a bit better?

Have you meet any other co workers in the same situation?

I was just thinking this guy most likely didn’t apply for a visa. I really think he didn’t apply for any type of visa. Then it had me thinking how can he be there without a visa?? From my understanding you would need some type of visa to stay in a country. He seems like he’s going to be doing nothing. Probably because Mary wouldn’t want him to work because there’s a chance he’ll work with women. From my experience I was thinking of going to South Korea with my boyfriend and I was going to teach English there. I would have needed a work visa for that. If Brandan was smart enough he should have went to the Philippines as an English teacher. It’s pretty easy to get a visa for that and it’s so high in demand. But I’m assuming he didn’t even think of that and Mary wouldn’t let him because of her jealously issues.

I’m just confused what is he going to do to stay there legally?? This couple is so confusing I have no words-",-0.8327,-0.8327,-0.8327,-0.8327,https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayFiance/comments/14xljxa/how_is_brandan_going_to_stay_in_the_philippines/,07/12/2023,16:13:12,moonxlight101,147,Asia

Visa,I got my Australian visa! What next?,"I got my Australian visa! What next? So ayun. After almost 5 years of waiting, processing documents, and more waiting. I finally have my permanent residence visa!

Anyway, I did my research and eto yung mga na -note ko na need ko gawin. Sa mga nakapag migrate na, pwede pakidagdagan kasi baka may importante pala akong nakalimutan. Haha

Before actually flying to Australia

1. Take the PDOS seminar para magkaron ng CFO sticker sa passport (kita ko may online seminar pero just wondering kung pano makukuha yung sticker kung online yung pinili?)
2. Secure enough funds for food, utilities, rent for first few months na wala pang work sa Australia (I actually plan na maghanap na ng work bago pa pumunta dun pero syempre para lang safe, plan ko magbudget kahit 3 mos worth)
3. Renew my PH drivers license (kasi sabi nila nacconvert daw to sa AU drivers license)
4. Talk to my PH banks to arrange yung mga OTP

Once I land in AU

1. Get an AU sim card
2. Open an AU bank account
3. Apply for Tax File Number, Centrelink Number, Medicare Number
4. Secure a rental property

Tapos, bilang galing tayo sa Pilipinas na sobrang tagal lagi anything related sa government, do you think mabilis lang makukuha yung mga nasa No. 3? Iniisip ko kasi mag airbnb muna ko sa 1st month ko pagdating AU habang wala pa kong nahahanap na rental property na long term. Kaso pano pag nagbago na ako ng address sa next month. Baka ipadala ung docs dun sa dati kong airbnb e nakalipat na ko sa ibang rental property? Or baka may iba kayong tips para dito? Wala kasi talaga ako kakilala don sa AU so pakikitira is not an option :(",0.9239,0.9239,0.9239,0.9239,https://www.reddit.com/r/phmigrate/comments/1577z9d/i_got_my_australian_visa_what_next/,07/23/2023,12:18:41,dreambigdreams01,72,Asia

Visa,"Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa","Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa I don't have other place to express my happiness then tell everyone on reddit. A little backstory we are not from USA. 

My brother (33M) is the worst scum of earth. I grew up in a chauvinist, cultish household where I had to behave so I didn't tarnish my family and no matter what happened my brother was the golden child. 

My brother would physically hurt my sisters and I, would make degrading comments like we were fat or ugly, critize our clothes, our cooking, our cleaning, yet he barely graduated HS. In the eyes of my parents he was not doing anything wrong, they would just tell him ""stop bothering your sisters"" and that was it. My brother grew up diminishing my sisters and I, I would cry in my room about the level of abuse.

My brother is a freeloader that hasn't work a single job in his life in our home country yet he went to USA to visit some relatives and decided to work on a tourist visa (as you know this is a HUGE no-no). From there on my brother thought of living in USA and never come back to my home country. 

Of course once the visa renewal came it was denied, my brother was heartbroken because obviously he has no work experience, single, has a Business degree (he graduated with the minimum requirements). He would tell my sisters and I to yive money monthly for house expenses and food, but I knew he was taking a portion to himself. 

He continued to be an a-hole but one day I decided to be the bigger person and open up to him, he stopped me and told me to my face ""I don't care about your life"". That was the moment I shut myself with him. And after years of abuse and discrimination for being a woman I found out he applied a second time for a visa and it was once again denied.

Error message on my ""Visa Application list"" that I was advised to ignore:
""An error occurred in process of inspection of the file. Upload a file again. passport number Pxxxxxxxx Name of the file null""
This error message was on my account from 30th May for about 3-4 days. But there was nothing I could do; no option to re-upload my passport, so I ignored it as advised by the consulate and customer hotline when I called them, respectively. 

Uploaded documents:
1. Passport photo (white background)
2. Passport copy (bio page and the following page) 
3. Emirates ID copy
4. Flight itinerary (already booked but pre-booking works as per requirements)
5. Bank statement last 3 months
6. Certificate of Employment (NOT NOC)
7. Schedule of Stay (use the form they provide on the website)
8. Hotel booking confirmation (pre-booking)
9. Residence visa copy (document to prove legal residency)

Notes: 
1. I uploaded all the above in pdf format, except for my passport photo. If you have more than one file per required document, you should upload in jpg or PNG format. 
However, even though I have 2 accommodations, I just merged them in 1 file and uploaded it in pdf like the rest.
 
2. Some required fields (like the hotel booking information) have limited character spaces, so if for example you have 2 accommodations, just write the contact number of the accommodation where you will stay the longest. As for the hotel name, try to write both. (What's more important is you write all your accommodation info on the Schedule of Stay form)

3. Schedule of Stay form. Just write ""Arrival to Japan via xx airport"" on your Day 0. I also added my accommodation info on Day 0 as this is the day I am moving there from the airport.

Visa,Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰,"Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰 Hi folks! I just want to let out a small rant. I'm from the UK and have been fortunate enough to spend a decent amount of time in Sydney. Between 2017-2018 I was here on a sponsored visa. I was promised by my employer that the move would be ""permanent"" so I invested quite heavily into ""settling down"" here. Only to learn 20 months later that my employer had botched my visa application and I suddenly found myself with 30 days to leave the country. I had an apartment filled with belongings, a girlfriend, and I had to abandon it all.

So back I was in the UK. It would take me another 3 years before I found a new Australian work sponsor, and another 4 years before I would actually arrive back here. That takes us to July 2022. I've been here (again) for a year now. And I have just been made redundant. I basically have 6 weeks to find a new sponsor before I have to leave everything behind again.

But I have always had to prepare for this possibility. I always knew it could happen. And that brings us back to the title of this post. Being here on a temporary visa without the security of being allowed to remain here is super stressful, because on the one hand, you want to try and build a life here, because ultimately I would like to get permanent residency, and I am living here full-time. But on the other hand, you have to be prepared to give it all up in a heartbeat. It means you cannot really let your guard down or really ever feel comfortable. You are always on edge.

It's been more than 6 years since I first had it in my head that I want to make Australia my home, I really do love it here compared to the UK. I'm in a fairly decent positive to make it happen, but it's still 50/50, and I could still be many years off making it happen.

That's about it really. I really just wanted to vent. I'm not complaining about the process or requesting any special treatment. Just wanted to express that life is good here, and there are many people (like me) who are sacrificing the best years of their lives just for a chance of being able to settle down here.

Visa,Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal,"Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal I booked my honeymoon package for greece and paid half of the amount (₹170000) in first week of April. Makemytrip visa team got in touch with me with list of documents to be submitted. I started preparing the required documents including bank statements, and affidavits from both of our parents as we were appearing for visa appointment before wedding. Got all the documents verified by the makemytrip visa team (Rubi was the POC). Me and my then fiancee (now wife) appeared for the visa appointment and submitted documents on April 21st. Total silence from GVCW (agency that takes documents for tourist visa and sends it to greek embassy for further processing) and the greek embassy. The next installment of payment to MMT was due on 30th may. I was really worried as there was no communication about visa processing, was really skeptical to pay the remaining half amount. Got in touch with my MakeMyTrip relationship manager (my poc for this booking) Ruchi and cried about this - that i didnt want to pay the rest as I am worried. She insisted I paid the full amount as visa will be processed - she said she knows people got greek visa recently who booked with MMT. I asked for extension if possible, she denied straight and asked me to pay or else she said the full booking would be cancelled. I paid as I was worried about loosing the already paid amount in case visa gets approved and bookings are cancelled. 
Approx around 17th of June, got my passport back with visa refusal letter with a reason: “The information submitted regarding the justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable”. The documents related to booking of flights and hotels were all provided by Makemytrip. All of these documents were verified by Makemytrip visa team. Still got this refusal.

I called the airline (Indigo) with the reason - they mentioned that booking can be cancelled and I can get around ₹90000 refund. Similarly I called all the hotels and they confirmed that they would refund the amount as the reason is genuine and they don’t have a problem to refund as this was almost 20days before the trip dates. All the other bookings were fully refundable as I checked the policies on individual products/service/experience websites. 
I got in touch with MMT visa team, they asked me to send the refusal letter over an email which I did. After that I got in touch with my RO (Ruchi) - she was copied in my email. After many attempts she picked up the call and said that okay I will process the cancellation - I told about the airline and hotel refunds - to which she said if that is the case I should have no problem getting my money back less some cancellation penalty. 

I got email from Indigo that booking has been cancelled and refund amount is approx ₹90000.

After this Ruchi stopped responding to my whatsapp messages and stopped picking up my calls. 

On July 14th Ruchi responds to my whatsapp ping and says there is no refund. 

I am feeling like I am scammed. MMT made me pay fully, they processed bookings, told me what documents to submit for visa - they got the refunds but I have to face big financial loss for no reason. I am not sure how I can even measure my mental trauma. This was supposed to be my honeymoon trip and it ends like this. How can makemytrip keep all this refund money?

I was curious to know how Pearl was able to move to the UK and spew her bullshit, since I'm also an immigrant to the UK and know for a fact there is no visa that allows her to do what she does. 

On twitter, she's said she moved here to play professional volleyball. You're only allowed to do VERY specific second jobs on a sports/work visa and sure as hell NOT allowed to start a 'business' and employ a team of editors etc. as Pearl has said.

Her name is not listed as a registered business owner in the UK. She is probably paying her 'team' under the table, not paying UK taxes, and if she's making more than ~$100,000, she's evading USA tax as well.

On twitter she's said she wants to move back to the USA, but damn, if the Home Office finds out what she's been probably doing here, her dumbass could perma banned from entering the UK and convicted of tax fraud in both the UK and USA.

Again, this is all **IN MY OPINION** but the fact that she's seemed to blow up very fast online tells me she did not have this all worked out with immigration and tax lawyers and is probably doing a lot of illegal shit under the radar.",-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/14bypfv/pear_is_100_violating_the_terms_of_her_visa_in/,06/17/2023,23:55:19,marius_ann,90,Asia

If you are applying for a visa around this time and you have a deadline you need to meet, then you should strongly consider paying for priority service. My personal suggestion:

* If you need to travel in less than 8 weeks, get priority service
* If you need to travel within 1-3 weeks, get super priority

There is NO point in calling/emailing the hotline (a 3rd party service staffed by Sitel UK, not UKVI) to escalate your visa decision because you don't have it quickly enough. We don't have any evidence that the call centre actually follows any protocol for escalation, and from what I've seen, they tell everyone they've ""escalated"" with no indication they've actually done so, unless the case is exceptional. The hotline is intended to take your money and fob you off.

Realistically, you should be prepared to pay for a faster service if you have to be in the UK at a certain time. Please remember to apply as early in advance as possible (usually 3 months for most visas).",0.816,0.816,0.816,0.816,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1598ega/reminder_student_visa_season_affects_all_visa/,07/25/2023,18:21:30,clever_octopus,26,Asia

Visa,AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”?,"AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”? Context: My mum is Thai, and my dad is Dutch. I grew up in Thailand.  My mum married again and I have a stepsister who is 3 years older than me. 

My stepsister always brings up stuff like “you have no idea how hard travelling is for us because you have a strong passport” whenever she’s feeling stressed about travelling. 

My family (me, mum, stepsister, stepdad), are currently planning a trip to Germany. They’re in the process of applying for a Schengen visa. I think seeing me relaxing and unstressed about the whole thing grated on my sister because I’m just chilling while they’re running around getting flight tickets, proof of accommodation, statement of purpose, bank statements, travel health insurance, money for the visa fee and a bunch more stuff. 

She finally snapped and was like “aren’t you even going to try to be helpful? At least share the visa fee with us”. I said no. I am financially contributing the same amount she is to the trip, the visa fee is just an added expense she has that I don’t. 

She was unhappy because “I just don’t get it” and kept telling me things would only be “fair” if I agreed to share that cost, at least.  She’s been giving me the cold shoulder since because she thinks I’m a bit of an ass. 

My mum would like me to apologise to her and agree to share the cost at which point she would then reimburse me just to keep the peace.",0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s7n71/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_the_cost_of_my/,07/06/2023,17:24:09,PersonalStation7321,554,Other
Visa,Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays.,"Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays. My wife is non-European origin and visibly Muslim. She had an itinerary as follows MTL to London Heatherow to Istanbul international with the Airline and then her flight to her country with a separate airline. We live in Ontario - this post is on-going she is currently detained in Germany! A country she was never even supposed to be in.

Her first flight was delayed and she along with 100 others or so missed their connecting flights. After waiting in line for 2.5 hrs in London she was given a new ticket and told to run to the gate so she might make it to Istanbul on time. The new flight routed her through a small German airport that didn't have an international transit area. 

My wife gets off the plane runs towards her next gate because the flights were really close and when she gets to passport control 
 she is detained by Germain passport control for not having a German visa ( doesn't have a Canadian passport yet). 
She is given a criminal offense- unlawful entry, is humiliated in public by being escorted by police. She is searched and held in a holding area  until a flight out can be arranged. This is her second international trip the first was to Canada. She was balling and crying for hours, 20 hrs in her voice is still shaking when she talks to me.

 This was a direct assault on our dignity and she was treated like a criminal and detained for what will be about 24 hrs by the time shes escorted to her flight to Istanbul ( new flight). 

Airline did nothing to help. I called several times, they ran us around and finally suggested I need to buy new ticket to get her to Istanbul or Canada.
 They dumped her in the wrong country then tell us we have to spend more money to get her to the destination all because she was detained due to their negligence.  I'm livid. Sorry for the inconvenience they say. Apparently getting arrested in a foreign country you had no intention of visiting and then being banned from entry for life is an inconvenience.  

She is traumatized and still in detention her flight out is in a few hours and needless to say her final flight had to also be repurchased..I want to sue the Airline all legal advice is appreciated.

Her new flight is with another airline. The last I heard from the first airline is "" they are trying to get in touch with German authorities"". Not once did they call her...",-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/151nte9/airline_got_my_wife_detained_by_routing_her/,07/17/2023,06:25:58,talktomesexytimes,265,Other

Visa,Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland,"Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland Liebe Gewerbetreibende,

ich bin gerade mal wieder im Urlaub... Letztes Mal in Schweden, dieses Mal in Frankreich. Was mir mal wieder massiv auffällt: ich konnte in Schweden bei der kleinsten Eisbude im Hinterland mit VISA zahlen und hier in Frankreich ist es das Selbe: ich kann an jeder noch so kleinen Bumsbude mit der VISA zahlen. Kein Problem!

Warum verflucht nochmal bekommen es andere EU Länder hin selbst bei Pommesbuden VISA Karte als Zahlungsmittel zu haben und wir in Deutschland können nicht mal in Touristenorten in allen Geschäften mit VISA Zahlen. In der Eisdiele erwarte ich es ja nicht mal - obwohl auch das kein Problem zu sein scheint - aber verflucht nochmal warum in Geschäften nicht?

Ich bin mittlerweile an einem Punkt angekommen an dem ich ein Geschäft wieder verlasse wenn keine Visa akzeptiert wird. Dann macht den Umsatz eben ein Anderer. Die Höhe war vor dem Urlaub meine Werkstatt: beim Bezahlen mit der Visa fragt mich der Werkstattmeister (und Eigentümer), ob ich nicht eine andere Karte dabei habe, bei VISA bekommt er nicht den vollen Betrag... Weil ihm das bei den Apothekenpreisen seiner Leistungen auch das Bein bricht wenn ~1,2% Gebühren weg gehen. War das letzte Mal, dass ich mein Auto bei ihm abgegeben habe, das hab ich ihm auch gesagt. Finde das unverschämt, Geld verdienen wollen aber nichts dafür ausgeben wollen.

Liebe Gewerbetreibende! Rafft euch mal. Bietet VISA an und geht mit der Zeit. Es kann nicht sein, dass wir in Deutschland bei den Zahlungsmitteln auf dem Stand der 90er stehen bleiben, nur weil ihr 1,2% mehr Gewinn machen könntet. Falls ihr wegen den 1,2% nicht mehr profitabel seid sperrts den Laden bitte zu... Dann habt ihr eh ein Problem. Kommt mal im Jahr 2023 an... Bitte! Danke!

Visa,Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore.,"Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore. Background: 

I arrived in Thailand July 2021 and stayed with COVID extensions until October 2022. After that, I arranged an education visa that went into effect January 2023 and expires January 2024. 

I never broke the law in Thailand or had any other issues with the authorities here. 

However, despite doing everything by the book and securing a reentry permit before leaving Thailand, and despite being cleared at the airport and allowed to enter Thailand through Phuket, Thai immigration just denied my education visa renewal after I made my appointment with them this morning. 

Their reasoning is that I travelled on the education visa too frequently.

These were my trips:

1) One trip to Israel in March 2023 to help my dad with health issues. 

2) One trip to Dubai in May 2023 for only 3 days. 

3) Another trip to Israel after my dad recently suffered a stroke and almost died in July 2023. 

The immigration officer didn't care about my story, either. I was just another number to them. 

Sometimes life throws you punches. Not only did I almost just lose my dad this month, but I just lost my home in Thailand. But it's OK. Everything happens for a reason, and I planned on returning to Israel very shortly as it is to continue taking care of my dad. I'm just posting this as a warning to others: do not rely on education visas any longer. Thai authorities are cracking down on them, and they are not a good way to live in Thailand long term if you need to travel.

Visa,PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you!,"PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you! This situation is ASB-specific, but it seems possible to me that other banks might be affected too. If you bank with ASB, you need to know this, and if you don't, it's probably still a good idea for you to call your bank and ask how they handle it.

The story goes: A week ago, I used the ASB mobile app's 'cancel and replace card' feature. I had loaded my ASB VISA debit card details into a family member's Uber account, and in an abundance of caution, once that was no longer needed, I figured I should cancel and replace the card. It doesn't hurt to do that every year or two regardless, as a general security principle, right?

So I did the 'cancel and replace' thing in the app.

It's a week later now, and I still haven't received the new card in the mail, but that's just because NZ Post is shit. Anyway, I'm idly reviewing my bank transactions today, as you do, and I see that my monthly Playstation Network subscription has been successfully charged to my ASB account. Now, I'd forgotten about that PSN subscription that I'd set up on the now-cancelled card. All PSN had was my old ASB debit VISA card details. I should've received an email from PSN complaining about a failed payment. Yet they're still successfully charging me!

So I called ASB customer service, and had an interesting conversation with a very nice lady, who explained:

- There is a feature offered by VISA and MasterCard where a merchant who is going to process recurring card transactions can get a 'secure token' to charge, instead of using the actual card details themselves. (This seems like a good security feature to me - the customer support lady wasn't really familiar with how it worked, but I assume the token can only be used to initiate charges by the merchant it was issued to, meaning that if the merchant's stored payment data is stolen, nobody can use the info to make fraudulent card transactions. Good design, props to VISA and MasterCard.)

- These 'chargeable secure tokens' are created by the card-issuing bank, when a merchant provides a customer's card details and requests a token.

- In ASB's case, it seems that the tokens are linked *to your bank account*, as if they were entirely separate debit cards, not *to the card itself*. So, when you cancel and replace a card, you effectively, unbeknownst to you, can have any number of 'virtual card' tokens still floating around out in the world, held by the merchants who asked your bank for them, and those merchants can still use them to take money off you, regardless of whether the card details you originally gave them are still valid or not.

- ASB customer service workers have a standing instruction, when someone calls up to ask to cancel and replace a card, to manually go through and delete all of the 'virtual card tokens' linked to that customer's accounts in their system.

- However, if a customer just uses the 'cancel and replace card' feature in the ASB mobile app, there is no mention of these 'virtual card tokens', no mention that you need to call customer service to complete the cancellation process, and no automated deletion of any virtual card tokens. The tokens just stay there in ASB's system, and the merchants who created them can keep using them to charge you, until you call up ASB customer service and ask them to manually delete the tokens.

So, if you're an ASB customer, and you need to cancel and replace a debit or credit card, and you want to be sure that nobody who you gave the old card details to can still charge you through it: *you have to telephone customer support, you cannot rely on doing it via the mobile app*.

For non-ASB customers: If I were you, I'd call my bank and ask how this stuff is handled. Does your bank automatically delete all current virtual card tokens when the debit or credit card used to create them is cancelled?

And, if anyone senior at ASB is reading this: for god's sake, guys, start keeping a record of what card was used to create each virtual card token, and automatically invalidate the tokens when the card is invalidated! How did that not get designed in from the start? At the very least, update your mobile banking app's cancel-and-replace feature to pop up a warning that recurring charges might still be processed against the cancelled card unless the customer calls ASB's customer support line!

Editing to share a realization I had while engaging in the comments below:

This system behaviour, as disturbing as it is for us schmucks out there swiping our cards, benefits merchants by making it easier for them to take our money.

Merchants pay the transaction fees each time a card is swiped. So the *merchants* are the bank's customers for card products.

And so the banks are going to design their systems in whatever way makes the merchants happiest.

This will be why none of us have ever seen proactive advertising from our banks explaining how this system works.

Because if we all knew about it, if it was fully in the public eye, enough of us might be unhappy about it that it might be difficult for the banks to keep doing it. The banks might have to change to deleting tokens by default on card cancels, or maybe just ensuring that we're told about it and given a clear choice on what will happen. Imagine if the Banking Ombudsman decided that this was something that banks had a responsibility to ensure that customers were made fully aware of, instead of only mentioning it when customers asked about unexpected charges?",0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/14nn025/psa_i_learned_today_that_cancelling_and_replacing/,07/01/2023,10:50:15,jrandom_42,123,Other

Visa,"Senior dev on a Visa, underpaid and fulfilling other roles","Senior dev on a Visa, underpaid and fulfilling other roles *My goal with this post is to bring visibility of what some companies do to their immigrants, how some of us can get stuck in the bureaucracy of US immigration laws and to get some love from peers during complex work statuses.*

Hi, 12 years of experience dev here, I currently live in the Austin, Texas, I got transferred here 4 years with an L1. Worked for the same company for 9 years and made my way as senior dev here. Joined them when it was a start up and now is a multi national company in public market (it got acquired).

After many years of back and forth with different company managers I accepted the Visa to be transferred here with the goal of get promoted as a tech lead or team manager. 4 years later that never happened. I asked multiple times what are they waiting for and the answer is that they are waiting for my green card to be approved (the company lawyers are working on it but they haven't filed it yet).

My reality now is that they are keeping me underpaid ($70K), asking for raise leads to the same answer as for my promotion. My engineering manager quit and I'm fulfilling that role as I'm the only senior dev in the team, and the company is not opening a new manager position.

I know that the easy answer is ""quit"", but in the case of my visa that means to get back to my country (which I don't want). I'm currently in the process of getting a green card on my own means but it takes time.

What things can I do to make this time until a get my green card a bit better?

Have you meet any other co workers in the same situation?

I was just thinking this guy most likely didn’t apply for a visa. I really think he didn’t apply for any type of visa. Then it had me thinking how can he be there without a visa?? From my understanding you would need some type of visa to stay in a country. He seems like he’s going to be doing nothing. Probably because Mary wouldn’t want him to work because there’s a chance he’ll work with women. From my experience I was thinking of going to South Korea with my boyfriend and I was going to teach English there. I would have needed a work visa for that. If Brandan was smart enough he should have went to the Philippines as an English teacher. It’s pretty easy to get a visa for that and it’s so high in demand. But I’m assuming he didn’t even think of that and Mary wouldn’t let him because of her jealously issues.

Visa,I got my Australian visa! What next?,"I got my Australian visa! What next? So ayun. After almost 5 years of waiting, processing documents, and more waiting. I finally have my permanent residence visa!

Anyway, I did my research and eto yung mga na -note ko na need ko gawin. Sa mga nakapag migrate na, pwede pakidagdagan kasi baka may importante pala akong nakalimutan. Haha

Before actually flying to Australia

1. Take the PDOS seminar para magkaron ng CFO sticker sa passport (kita ko may online seminar pero just wondering kung pano makukuha yung sticker kung online yung pinili?)
2. Secure enough funds for food, utilities, rent for first few months na wala pang work sa Australia (I actually plan na maghanap na ng work bago pa pumunta dun pero syempre para lang safe, plan ko magbudget kahit 3 mos worth)
3. Renew my PH drivers license (kasi sabi nila nacconvert daw to sa AU drivers license)
4. Talk to my PH banks to arrange yung mga OTP

Once I land in AU

1. Get an AU sim card
2. Open an AU bank account
3. Apply for Tax File Number, Centrelink Number, Medicare Number
4. Secure a rental property

Tapos, bilang galing tayo sa Pilipinas na sobrang tagal lagi anything related sa government, do you think mabilis lang makukuha yung mga nasa No. 3? Iniisip ko kasi mag airbnb muna ko sa 1st month ko pagdating AU habang wala pa kong nahahanap na rental property na long term. Kaso pano pag nagbago na ako ng address sa next month. Baka ipadala ung docs dun sa dati kong airbnb e nakalipat na ko sa ibang rental property? Or baka may iba kayong tips para dito?

Visa,"Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa","Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa I don't have other place to express my happiness then tell everyone on reddit. A little backstory we are not from USA. 

My brother (33M) is the worst scum of earth. I grew up in a chauvinist, cultish household where I had to behave so I didn't tarnish my family and no matter what happened my brother was the golden child. 

My brother would physically hurt my sisters and I, would make degrading comments like we were fat or ugly, critize our clothes, our cooking, our cleaning, yet he barely graduated HS. In the eyes of my parents he was not doing anything wrong, they would just tell him ""stop bothering your sisters"" and that was it. My brother grew up diminishing my sisters and I, I would cry in my room about the level of abuse.

My brother is a freeloader that hasn't work a single job in his life in our home country yet he went to USA to visit some relatives and decided to work on a tourist visa (as you know this is a HUGE no-no). From there on my brother thought of living in USA and never come back to my home country. 

Of course once the visa renewal came it was denied, my brother was heartbroken because obviously he has no work experience, single, has a Business degree (he graduated with the minimum requirements). He would tell my sisters and I to yive money monthly for house expenses and food, but I knew he was taking a portion to himself. 

He continued to be an a-hole but one day I decided to be the bigger person and open up to him, he stopped me and told me to my face ""I don't care about your life"". That was the moment I shut myself with him. And after years of abuse and discrimination for being a woman I found out he applied a second time for a visa and it was once again denied.

8 June at 9:22 am: Notification of Electronic VISA ISSUANCE email (SE)

Error message on my ""Visa Application list"" that I was advised to ignore:
""An error occurred in process of inspection of the file. Upload a file again. passport number Pxxxxxxxx Name of the file null""
This error message was on my account from 30th May for about 3-4 days. But there was nothing I could do; no option to re-upload my passport, so I ignored it as advised by the consulate and customer hotline when I called them, respectively. 

Uploaded documents:
1. Passport photo (white background)
2. Passport copy (bio page and the following page) 
3. Emirates ID copy
4. Flight itinerary (already booked but pre-booking works as per requirements)
5. Bank statement last 3 months
6. Certificate of Employment (NOT NOC)
7. Schedule of Stay (use the form they provide on the website)
8. Hotel booking confirmation (pre-booking)
9. Residence visa copy (document to prove legal residency)

Notes: 
1. I uploaded all the above in pdf format, except for my passport photo. If you have more than one file per required document, you should upload in jpg or PNG format. 
However, even though I have 2 accommodations, I just merged them in 1 file and uploaded it in pdf like the rest.
 
2. Some required fields (like the hotel booking information) have limited character spaces, so if for example you have 2 accommodations, just write the contact number of the accommodation where you will stay the longest. As for the hotel name, try to write both. (What's more important is you write all your accommodation info on the Schedule of Stay form)

3. Schedule of Stay form. Just write ""Arrival to Japan via xx airport"" on your Day 0. I also added my accommodation info on Day 0 as this is the day I am moving there from the airport.

Visa,Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰,"Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰 Hi folks! I just want to let out a small rant. I'm from the UK and have been fortunate enough to spend a decent amount of time in Sydney. Between 2017-2018 I was here on a sponsored visa. I was promised by my employer that the move would be ""permanent"" so I invested quite heavily into ""settling down"" here. Only to learn 20 months later that my employer had botched my visa application and I suddenly found myself with 30 days to leave the country. I had an apartment filled with belongings, a girlfriend, and I had to abandon it all.

So back I was in the UK. It would take me another 3 years before I found a new Australian work sponsor, and another 4 years before I would actually arrive back here. That takes us to July 2022. I've been here (again) for a year now. And I have just been made redundant. I basically have 6 weeks to find a new sponsor before I have to leave everything behind again.

But I have always had to prepare for this possibility. I always knew it could happen. And that brings us back to the title of this post. Being here on a temporary visa without the security of being allowed to remain here is super stressful, because on the one hand, you want to try and build a life here, because ultimately I would like to get permanent residency, and I am living here full-time. But on the other hand, you have to be prepared to give it all up in a heartbeat. It means you cannot really let your guard down or really ever feel comfortable. You are always on edge.

It's been more than 6 years since I first had it in my head that I want to make Australia my home, I really do love it here compared to the UK. I'm in a fairly decent positive to make it happen, but it's still 50/50, and I could still be many years off making it happen.

That's about it really. I really just wanted to vent. I'm not complaining about the process or requesting any special treatment. Just wanted to express that life is good here, and there are many people (like me) who are sacrificing the best years of their lives just for a chance of being able to settle down here.

Visa,Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal,"Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal I booked my honeymoon package for greece and paid half of the amount (₹170000) in first week of April. Makemytrip visa team got in touch with me with list of documents to be submitted. I started preparing the required documents including bank statements, and affidavits from both of our parents as we were appearing for visa appointment before wedding. Got all the documents verified by the makemytrip visa team (Rubi was the POC). Me and my then fiancee (now wife) appeared for the visa appointment and submitted documents on April 21st. Total silence from GVCW (agency that takes documents for tourist visa and sends it to greek embassy for further processing) and the greek embassy. The next installment of payment to MMT was due on 30th may. I was really worried as there was no communication about visa processing, was really skeptical to pay the remaining half amount. Got in touch with my MakeMyTrip relationship manager (my poc for this booking) Ruchi and cried about this - that i didnt want to pay the rest as I am worried. She insisted I paid the full amount as visa will be processed - she said she knows people got greek visa recently who booked with MMT. I asked for extension if possible, she denied straight and asked me to pay or else she said the full booking would be cancelled. I paid as I was worried about loosing the already paid amount in case visa gets approved and bookings are cancelled. 
Approx around 17th of June, got my passport back with visa refusal letter with a reason: “The information submitted regarding the justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable”. The documents related to booking of flights and hotels were all provided by Makemytrip. All of these documents were verified by Makemytrip visa team. Still got this refusal.

I called the airline (Indigo) with the reason - they mentioned that booking can be cancelled and I can get around ₹90000 refund. Similarly I called all the hotels and they confirmed that they would refund the amount as the reason is genuine and they don’t have a problem to refund as this was almost 20days before the trip dates. All the other bookings were fully refundable as I checked the policies on individual products/service/experience websites. 
I got in touch with MMT visa team, they asked me to send the refusal letter over an email which I did. After that I got in touch with my RO (Ruchi) - she was copied in my email. After many attempts she picked up the call and said that okay I will process the cancellation - I told about the airline and hotel refunds - to which she said if that is the case I should have no problem getting my money back less some cancellation penalty. 

I got email from Indigo that booking has been cancelled and refund amount is approx ₹90000.

After this Ruchi stopped responding to my whatsapp messages and stopped picking up my calls. 

On July 14th Ruchi responds to my whatsapp ping and says there is no refund. 

I am feeling like I am scammed. MMT made me pay fully, they processed bookings, told me what documents to submit for visa - they got the refunds but I have to face big financial loss for no reason. I am not sure how I can even measure my mental trauma. This was supposed to be my honeymoon trip and it ends like this. How can makemytrip keep all this refund money?

I was curious to know how Pearl was able to move to the UK and spew her bullshit, since I'm also an immigrant to the UK and know for a fact there is no visa that allows her to do what she does. 

On twitter, she's said she moved here to play professional volleyball. You're only allowed to do VERY specific second jobs on a sports/work visa and sure as hell NOT allowed to start a 'business' and employ a team of editors etc. as Pearl has said.

Her name is not listed as a registered business owner in the UK. She is probably paying her 'team' under the table, not paying UK taxes, and if she's making more than ~$100,000, she's evading USA tax as well.

On twitter she's said she wants to move back to the USA, but damn, if the Home Office finds out what she's been probably doing here, her dumbass could perma banned from entering the UK and convicted of tax fraud in both the UK and USA.

Again, this is all **IN MY OPINION** but the fact that she's seemed to blow up very fast online tells me she did not have this all worked out with immigration and tax lawyers and is probably doing a lot of illegal shit under the radar.",-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/14bypfv/pear_is_100_violating_the_terms_of_her_visa_in/,06/17/2023,23:55:19,marius_ann,90,Other

If you are applying for a visa around this time and you have a deadline you need to meet, then you should strongly consider paying for priority service. My personal suggestion:

* If you need to travel in less than 8 weeks, get priority service
* If you need to travel within 1-3 weeks, get super priority

There is NO point in calling/emailing the hotline (a 3rd party service staffed by Sitel UK, not UKVI) to escalate your visa decision because you don't have it quickly enough. We don't have any evidence that the call centre actually follows any protocol for escalation, and from what I've seen, they tell everyone they've ""escalated"" with no indication they've actually done so, unless the case is exceptional. The hotline is intended to take your money and fob you off.

Realistically, you should be prepared to pay for a faster service if you have to be in the UK at a certain time. Please remember to apply as early in advance as possible (usually 3 months for most visas).",0.816,0.816,0.816,0.816,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1598ega/reminder_student_visa_season_affects_all_visa/,07/25/2023,18:21:30,clever_octopus,26,Other

Visa,AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”?,"AITA for not wanting to share the cost of my sister’s visa fee because I have “passport privilege”? Context: My mum is Thai, and my dad is Dutch. I grew up in Thailand.  My mum married again and I have a stepsister who is 3 years older than me. 

My stepsister always brings up stuff like “you have no idea how hard travelling is for us because you have a strong passport” whenever she’s feeling stressed about travelling. 

My family (me, mum, stepsister, stepdad), are currently planning a trip to Germany. They’re in the process of applying for a Schengen visa. I think seeing me relaxing and unstressed about the whole thing grated on my sister because I’m just chilling while they’re running around getting flight tickets, proof of accommodation, statement of purpose, bank statements, travel health insurance, money for the visa fee and a bunch more stuff. 

She finally snapped and was like “aren’t you even going to try to be helpful? At least share the visa fee with us”. I said no. I am financially contributing the same amount she is to the trip, the visa fee is just an added expense she has that I don’t. 

She was unhappy because “I just don’t get it” and kept telling me things would only be “fair” if I agreed to share that cost, at least.  She’s been giving me the cold shoulder since because she thinks I’m a bit of an ass. 

My mum would like me to apologise to her and agree to share the cost at which point she would then reimburse me just to keep the peace.",0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,0.8912,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s7n71/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_the_cost_of_my/,07/06/2023,17:24:09,PersonalStation7321,554,
Visa,Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays.,"Airline got my wife detained by routing her through a country for which she didn't have a visa after they switched her connections due to their delays. My wife is non-European origin and visibly Muslim. She had an itinerary as follows MTL to London Heatherow to Istanbul international with the Airline and then her flight to her country with a separate airline. We live in Ontario - this post is on-going she is currently detained in Germany! A country she was never even supposed to be in.

Her first flight was delayed and she along with 100 others or so missed their connecting flights. After waiting in line for 2.5 hrs in London she was given a new ticket and told to run to the gate so she might make it to Istanbul on time. The new flight routed her through a small German airport that didn't have an international transit area. 

My wife gets off the plane runs towards her next gate because the flights were really close and when she gets to passport control 
 she is detained by Germain passport control for not having a German visa ( doesn't have a Canadian passport yet). 
She is given a criminal offense- unlawful entry, is humiliated in public by being escorted by police. She is searched and held in a holding area  until a flight out can be arranged. This is her second international trip the first was to Canada. She was balling and crying for hours, 20 hrs in her voice is still shaking when she talks to me.

 This was a direct assault on our dignity and she was treated like a criminal and detained for what will be about 24 hrs by the time shes escorted to her flight to Istanbul ( new flight). 

Airline did nothing to help. I called several times, they ran us around and finally suggested I need to buy new ticket to get her to Istanbul or Canada.
 They dumped her in the wrong country then tell us we have to spend more money to get her to the destination all because she was detained due to their negligence.  I'm livid. Sorry for the inconvenience they say. Apparently getting arrested in a foreign country you had no intention of visiting and then being banned from entry for life is an inconvenience.  

She is traumatized and still in detention her flight out is in a few hours and needless to say her final flight had to also be repurchased..I want to sue the Airline all legal advice is appreciated.

Her new flight is with another airline. The last I heard from the first airline is "" they are trying to get in touch with German authorities"". Not once did they call her...",-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,-0.9947,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/151nte9/airline_got_my_wife_detained_by_routing_her/,07/17/2023,06:25:58,talktomesexytimes,265,

Visa,Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland,"Rant: Liebe Gewerbetreibende - VISA Wüste Deutschland Liebe Gewerbetreibende,

ich bin gerade mal wieder im Urlaub... Letztes Mal in Schweden, dieses Mal in Frankreich. Was mir mal wieder massiv auffällt: ich konnte in Schweden bei der kleinsten Eisbude im Hinterland mit VISA zahlen und hier in Frankreich ist es das Selbe: ich kann an jeder noch so kleinen Bumsbude mit der VISA zahlen. Kein Problem!

Warum verflucht nochmal bekommen es andere EU Länder hin selbst bei Pommesbuden VISA Karte als Zahlungsmittel zu haben und wir in Deutschland können nicht mal in Touristenorten in allen Geschäften mit VISA Zahlen. In der Eisdiele erwarte ich es ja nicht mal - obwohl auch das kein Problem zu sein scheint - aber verflucht nochmal warum in Geschäften nicht?

Ich bin mittlerweile an einem Punkt angekommen an dem ich ein Geschäft wieder verlasse wenn keine Visa akzeptiert wird. Dann macht den Umsatz eben ein Anderer. Die Höhe war vor dem Urlaub meine Werkstatt: beim Bezahlen mit der Visa fragt mich der Werkstattmeister (und Eigentümer), ob ich nicht eine andere Karte dabei habe, bei VISA bekommt er nicht den vollen Betrag... Weil ihm das bei den Apothekenpreisen seiner Leistungen auch das Bein bricht wenn ~1,2% Gebühren weg gehen. War das letzte Mal, dass ich mein Auto bei ihm abgegeben habe, das hab ich ihm auch gesagt. Finde das unverschämt, Geld verdienen wollen aber nichts dafür ausgeben wollen.

Liebe Gewerbetreibende! Rafft euch mal. Bietet VISA an und geht mit der Zeit. Es kann nicht sein, dass wir in Deutschland bei den Zahlungsmitteln auf dem Stand der 90er stehen bleiben, nur weil ihr 1,2% mehr Gewinn machen könntet. Falls ihr wegen den 1,2% nicht mehr profitabel seid sperrts den Laden bitte zu... Dann habt ihr eh ein Problem. Kommt mal im Jahr 2023 an... Bitte! Danke!

What do you think I can do legally? I am 100% sure now that he used me for visa and showed his true colors after his arrival. As he refused to divorce, we strated a trial but it won't move forward until the end of the year.

Visa,Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore.,"Education visa renewal denied: Do not travel with an education visa. It's barely possible anymore. Background: 

I arrived in Thailand July 2021 and stayed with COVID extensions until October 2022. After that, I arranged an education visa that went into effect January 2023 and expires January 2024. 

I never broke the law in Thailand or had any other issues with the authorities here. 

However, despite doing everything by the book and securing a reentry permit before leaving Thailand, and despite being cleared at the airport and allowed to enter Thailand through Phuket, Thai immigration just denied my education visa renewal after I made my appointment with them this morning. 

Their reasoning is that I travelled on the education visa too frequently.

These were my trips:

1) One trip to Israel in March 2023 to help my dad with health issues. 

2) One trip to Dubai in May 2023 for only 3 days. 

3) Another trip to Israel after my dad recently suffered a stroke and almost died in July 2023. 

The immigration officer didn't care about my story, either. I was just another number to them. 

Sometimes life throws you punches. Not only did I almost just lose my dad this month, but I just lost my home in Thailand. But it's OK. Everything happens for a reason, and I planned on returning to Israel very shortly as it is to continue taking care of my dad. I'm just posting this as a warning to others: do not rely on education visas any longer. Thai authorities are cracking down on them, and they are not a good way to live in Thailand long term if you need to travel.

Visa,PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you!,"PSA: I learned today that cancelling and replacing your ASB debit VISA card using the ASB mobile app does NOT prevent merchants who had your old card number from continuing to charge you! This situation is ASB-specific, but it seems possible to me that other banks might be affected too. If you bank with ASB, you need to know this, and if you don't, it's probably still a good idea for you to call your bank and ask how they handle it.

The story goes: A week ago, I used the ASB mobile app's 'cancel and replace card' feature. I had loaded my ASB VISA debit card details into a family member's Uber account, and in an abundance of caution, once that was no longer needed, I figured I should cancel and replace the card. It doesn't hurt to do that every year or two regardless, as a general security principle, right?

So I did the 'cancel and replace' thing in the app.

It's a week later now, and I still haven't received the new card in the mail, but that's just because NZ Post is shit. Anyway, I'm idly reviewing my bank transactions today, as you do, and I see that my monthly Playstation Network subscription has been successfully charged to my ASB account. Now, I'd forgotten about that PSN subscription that I'd set up on the now-cancelled card. All PSN had was my old ASB debit VISA card details. I should've received an email from PSN complaining about a failed payment. Yet they're still successfully charging me!

So I called ASB customer service, and had an interesting conversation with a very nice lady, who explained:

- There is a feature offered by VISA and MasterCard where a merchant who is going to process recurring card transactions can get a 'secure token' to charge, instead of using the actual card details themselves. (This seems like a good security feature to me - the customer support lady wasn't really familiar with how it worked, but I assume the token can only be used to initiate charges by the merchant it was issued to, meaning that if the merchant's stored payment data is stolen, nobody can use the info to make fraudulent card transactions. Good design, props to VISA and MasterCard.)

- These 'chargeable secure tokens' are created by the card-issuing bank, when a merchant provides a customer's card details and requests a token.

- In ASB's case, it seems that the tokens are linked *to your bank account*, as if they were entirely separate debit cards, not *to the card itself*. So, when you cancel and replace a card, you effectively, unbeknownst to you, can have any number of 'virtual card' tokens still floating around out in the world, held by the merchants who asked your bank for them, and those merchants can still use them to take money off you, regardless of whether the card details you originally gave them are still valid or not.

- ASB customer service workers have a standing instruction, when someone calls up to ask to cancel and replace a card, to manually go through and delete all of the 'virtual card tokens' linked to that customer's accounts in their system.

- However, if a customer just uses the 'cancel and replace card' feature in the ASB mobile app, there is no mention of these 'virtual card tokens', no mention that you need to call customer service to complete the cancellation process, and no automated deletion of any virtual card tokens. The tokens just stay there in ASB's system, and the merchants who created them can keep using them to charge you, until you call up ASB customer service and ask them to manually delete the tokens.

So, if you're an ASB customer, and you need to cancel and replace a debit or credit card, and you want to be sure that nobody who you gave the old card details to can still charge you through it: *you have to telephone customer support, you cannot rely on doing it via the mobile app*.

For non-ASB customers: If I were you, I'd call my bank and ask how this stuff is handled. Does your bank automatically delete all current virtual card tokens when the debit or credit card used to create them is cancelled?

And, if anyone senior at ASB is reading this: for god's sake, guys, start keeping a record of what card was used to create each virtual card token, and automatically invalidate the tokens when the card is invalidated! How did that not get designed in from the start? At the very least, update your mobile banking app's cancel-and-replace feature to pop up a warning that recurring charges might still be processed against the cancelled card unless the customer calls ASB's customer support line!

Editing to share a realization I had while engaging in the comments below:

This system behaviour, as disturbing as it is for us schmucks out there swiping our cards, benefits merchants by making it easier for them to take our money.

Merchants pay the transaction fees each time a card is swiped. So the *merchants* are the bank's customers for card products.

And so the banks are going to design their systems in whatever way makes the merchants happiest.

This will be why none of us have ever seen proactive advertising from our banks explaining how this system works.

Because if we all knew about it, if it was fully in the public eye, enough of us might be unhappy about it that it might be difficult for the banks to keep doing it. The banks might have to change to deleting tokens by default on card cancels, or maybe just ensuring that we're told about it and given a clear choice on what will happen. Imagine if the Banking Ombudsman decided that this was something that banks had a responsibility to ensure that customers were made fully aware of, instead of only mentioning it when customers asked about unexpected charges?",0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,0.9896,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/14nn025/psa_i_learned_today_that_cancelling_and_replacing/,07/01/2023,10:50:15,jrandom_42,123,

Hi, 12 years of experience dev here, I currently live in the Austin, Texas, I got transferred here 4 years with an L1. Worked for the same company for 9 years and made my way as senior dev here. Joined them when it was a start up and now is a multi national company in public market (it got acquired).

After many years of back and forth with different company managers I accepted the Visa to be transferred here with the goal of get promoted as a tech lead or team manager. 4 years later that never happened. I asked multiple times what are they waiting for and the answer is that they are waiting for my green card to be approved (the company lawyers are working on it but they haven't filed it yet).

My reality now is that they are keeping me underpaid ($70K), asking for raise leads to the same answer as for my promotion. My engineering manager quit and I'm fulfilling that role as I'm the only senior dev in the team, and the company is not opening a new manager position.

I know that the easy answer is ""quit"", but in the case of my visa that means to get back to my country (which I don't want). I'm currently in the process of getting a green card on my own means but it takes time.

What things can I do to make this time until a get my green card a bit better?

Have you meet any other co workers in the same situation?

I was just thinking this guy most likely didn’t apply for a visa. I really think he didn’t apply for any type of visa. Then it had me thinking how can he be there without a visa?? From my understanding you would need some type of visa to stay in a country. He seems like he’s going to be doing nothing. Probably because Mary wouldn’t want him to work because there’s a chance he’ll work with women. From my experience I was thinking of going to South Korea with my boyfriend and I was going to teach English there. I would have needed a work visa for that. If Brandan was smart enough he should have went to the Philippines as an English teacher. It’s pretty easy to get a visa for that and it’s so high in demand. But I’m assuming he didn’t even think of that and Mary wouldn’t let him because of her jealously issues.

I’m just confused what is he going to do to stay there legally?? This couple is so confusing I have no words-",-0.8327,-0.8327,-0.8327,-0.8327,https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayFiance/comments/14xljxa/how_is_brandan_going_to_stay_in_the_philippines/,07/12/2023,16:13:12,moonxlight101,147,

Visa,I got my Australian visa! What next?,"I got my Australian visa! What next? So ayun. After almost 5 years of waiting, processing documents, and more waiting. I finally have my permanent residence visa!

Anyway, I did my research and eto yung mga na -note ko na need ko gawin. Sa mga nakapag migrate na, pwede pakidagdagan kasi baka may importante pala akong nakalimutan. Haha

Before actually flying to Australia

1. Take the PDOS seminar para magkaron ng CFO sticker sa passport (kita ko may online seminar pero just wondering kung pano makukuha yung sticker kung online yung pinili?)
2. Secure enough funds for food, utilities, rent for first few months na wala pang work sa Australia (I actually plan na maghanap na ng work bago pa pumunta dun pero syempre para lang safe, plan ko magbudget kahit 3 mos worth)
3. Renew my PH drivers license (kasi sabi nila nacconvert daw to sa AU drivers license)
4. Talk to my PH banks to arrange yung mga OTP

Once I land in AU

1. Get an AU sim card
2. Open an AU bank account
3. Apply for Tax File Number, Centrelink Number, Medicare Number
4. Secure a rental property

Tapos, bilang galing tayo sa Pilipinas na sobrang tagal lagi anything related sa government, do you think mabilis lang makukuha yung mga nasa No. 3? Iniisip ko kasi mag airbnb muna ko sa 1st month ko pagdating AU habang wala pa kong nahahanap na rental property na long term. Kaso pano pag nagbago na ako ng address sa next month. Baka ipadala ung docs dun sa dati kong airbnb e nakalipat na ko sa ibang rental property? Or baka may iba kayong tips para dito? Wala kasi talaga ako kakilala don sa AU so pakikitira is not an option :(",0.9239,0.9239,0.9239,0.9239,https://www.reddit.com/r/phmigrate/comments/1577z9d/i_got_my_australian_visa_what_next/,07/23/2023,12:18:41,dreambigdreams01,72,

Visa,"Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa","Karma hit my brother, they denied him the visa I don't have other place to express my happiness then tell everyone on reddit. A little backstory we are not from USA. 

My brother (33M) is the worst scum of earth. I grew up in a chauvinist, cultish household where I had to behave so I didn't tarnish my family and no matter what happened my brother was the golden child. 

My brother would physically hurt my sisters and I, would make degrading comments like we were fat or ugly, critize our clothes, our cooking, our cleaning, yet he barely graduated HS. In the eyes of my parents he was not doing anything wrong, they would just tell him ""stop bothering your sisters"" and that was it. My brother grew up diminishing my sisters and I, I would cry in my room about the level of abuse.

My brother is a freeloader that hasn't work a single job in his life in our home country yet he went to USA to visit some relatives and decided to work on a tourist visa (as you know this is a HUGE no-no). From there on my brother thought of living in USA and never come back to my home country. 

Of course once the visa renewal came it was denied, my brother was heartbroken because obviously he has no work experience, single, has a Business degree (he graduated with the minimum requirements). He would tell my sisters and I to yive money monthly for house expenses and food, but I knew he was taking a portion to himself. 

He continued to be an a-hole but one day I decided to be the bigger person and open up to him, he stopped me and told me to my face ""I don't care about your life"". That was the moment I shut myself with him. And after years of abuse and discrimination for being a woman I found out he applied a second time for a visa and it was once again denied.

Error message on my ""Visa Application list"" that I was advised to ignore:
""An error occurred in process of inspection of the file. Upload a file again. passport number Pxxxxxxxx Name of the file null""
This error message was on my account from 30th May for about 3-4 days. But there was nothing I could do; no option to re-upload my passport, so I ignored it as advised by the consulate and customer hotline when I called them, respectively. 

Uploaded documents:
1. Passport photo (white background)
2. Passport copy (bio page and the following page) 
3. Emirates ID copy
4. Flight itinerary (already booked but pre-booking works as per requirements)
5. Bank statement last 3 months
6. Certificate of Employment (NOT NOC)
7. Schedule of Stay (use the form they provide on the website)
8. Hotel booking confirmation (pre-booking)
9. Residence visa copy (document to prove legal residency)

Notes: 
1. I uploaded all the above in pdf format, except for my passport photo. If you have more than one file per required document, you should upload in jpg or PNG format. 
However, even though I have 2 accommodations, I just merged them in 1 file and uploaded it in pdf like the rest.
 
2. Some required fields (like the hotel booking information) have limited character spaces, so if for example you have 2 accommodations, just write the contact number of the accommodation where you will stay the longest. As for the hotel name, try to write both. (What's more important is you write all your accommodation info on the Schedule of Stay form)

3. Schedule of Stay form. Just write ""Arrival to Japan via xx airport"" on your Day 0. I also added my accommodation info on Day 0 as this is the day I am moving there from the airport.

Visa,Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰,"Being here on a temporary visa is so stressful 😰 Hi folks! I just want to let out a small rant. I'm from the UK and have been fortunate enough to spend a decent amount of time in Sydney. Between 2017-2018 I was here on a sponsored visa. I was promised by my employer that the move would be ""permanent"" so I invested quite heavily into ""settling down"" here. Only to learn 20 months later that my employer had botched my visa application and I suddenly found myself with 30 days to leave the country. I had an apartment filled with belongings, a girlfriend, and I had to abandon it all.

So back I was in the UK. It would take me another 3 years before I found a new Australian work sponsor, and another 4 years before I would actually arrive back here. That takes us to July 2022. I've been here (again) for a year now. And I have just been made redundant. I basically have 6 weeks to find a new sponsor before I have to leave everything behind again.

But I have always had to prepare for this possibility. I always knew it could happen. And that brings us back to the title of this post. Being here on a temporary visa without the security of being allowed to remain here is super stressful, because on the one hand, you want to try and build a life here, because ultimately I would like to get permanent residency, and I am living here full-time. But on the other hand, you have to be prepared to give it all up in a heartbeat. It means you cannot really let your guard down or really ever feel comfortable. You are always on edge.

It's been more than 6 years since I first had it in my head that I want to make Australia my home, I really do love it here compared to the UK. I'm in a fairly decent positive to make it happen, but it's still 50/50, and I could still be many years off making it happen.

That's about it really. I really just wanted to vent. I'm not complaining about the process or requesting any special treatment. Just wanted to express that life is good here, and there are many people (like me) who are sacrificing the best years of their lives just for a chance of being able to settle down here.

Visa,Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal,"Makemytrip is keeping the refund money after visa refusal I booked my honeymoon package for greece and paid half of the amount (₹170000) in first week of April. Makemytrip visa team got in touch with me with list of documents to be submitted. I started preparing the required documents including bank statements, and affidavits from both of our parents as we were appearing for visa appointment before wedding. Got all the documents verified by the makemytrip visa team (Rubi was the POC). Me and my then fiancee (now wife) appeared for the visa appointment and submitted documents on April 21st. Total silence from GVCW (agency that takes documents for tourist visa and sends it to greek embassy for further processing) and the greek embassy. The next installment of payment to MMT was due on 30th may. I was really worried as there was no communication about visa processing, was really skeptical to pay the remaining half amount. Got in touch with my MakeMyTrip relationship manager (my poc for this booking) Ruchi and cried about this - that i didnt want to pay the rest as I am worried. She insisted I paid the full amount as visa will be processed - she said she knows people got greek visa recently who booked with MMT. I asked for extension if possible, she denied straight and asked me to pay or else she said the full booking would be cancelled. I paid as I was worried about loosing the already paid amount in case visa gets approved and bookings are cancelled. 
Approx around 17th of June, got my passport back with visa refusal letter with a reason: “The information submitted regarding the justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable”. The documents related to booking of flights and hotels were all provided by Makemytrip. All of these documents were verified by Makemytrip visa team. Still got this refusal.

I called the airline (Indigo) with the reason - they mentioned that booking can be cancelled and I can get around ₹90000 refund. Similarly I called all the hotels and they confirmed that they would refund the amount as the reason is genuine and they don’t have a problem to refund as this was almost 20days before the trip dates. All the other bookings were fully refundable as I checked the policies on individual products/service/experience websites. 
I got in touch with MMT visa team, they asked me to send the refusal letter over an email which I did. After that I got in touch with my RO (Ruchi) - she was copied in my email. After many attempts she picked up the call and said that okay I will process the cancellation - I told about the airline and hotel refunds - to which she said if that is the case I should have no problem getting my money back less some cancellation penalty. 

I got email from Indigo that booking has been cancelled and refund amount is approx ₹90000.

After this Ruchi stopped responding to my whatsapp messages and stopped picking up my calls. 

On July 14th Ruchi responds to my whatsapp ping and says there is no refund. 

I am feeling like I am scammed. MMT made me pay fully, they processed bookings, told me what documents to submit for visa - they got the refunds but I have to face big financial loss for no reason. I am not sure how I can even measure my mental trauma. This was supposed to be my honeymoon trip and it ends like this. How can makemytrip keep all this refund money?

I was curious to know how Pearl was able to move to the UK and spew her bullshit, since I'm also an immigrant to the UK and know for a fact there is no visa that allows her to do what she does. 

On twitter, she's said she moved here to play professional volleyball. You're only allowed to do VERY specific second jobs on a sports/work visa and sure as hell NOT allowed to start a 'business' and employ a team of editors etc. as Pearl has said.

Her name is not listed as a registered business owner in the UK. She is probably paying her 'team' under the table, not paying UK taxes, and if she's making more than ~$100,000, she's evading USA tax as well.

On twitter she's said she wants to move back to the USA, but damn, if the Home Office finds out what she's been probably doing here, her dumbass could perma banned from entering the UK and convicted of tax fraud in both the UK and USA.

Again, this is all **IN MY OPINION** but the fact that she's seemed to blow up very fast online tells me she did not have this all worked out with immigration and tax lawyers and is probably doing a lot of illegal shit under the radar.",-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,-0.9884,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/14bypfv/pear_is_100_violating_the_terms_of_her_visa_in/,06/17/2023,23:55:19,marius_ann,90,

Visa,REMINDER: Student visa season affects all visa applications,"REMINDER: Student visa season affects all visa applications Hey everyone, just a reminder that we are deep within Student Visa Season.

Between June-Oct, UKVI diverts caseworkers to student visas, which take priority during this season, and all visas may take longer than usual. UKVI will often exceed their 3-week estimate. 

If you are applying for a visa around this time and you have a deadline you need to meet, then you should strongly consider paying for priority service. My personal suggestion:

There is NO point in calling/emailing the hotline (a 3rd party service staffed by Sitel UK, not UKVI) to escalate your visa decision because you don't have it quickly enough. We don't have any evidence that the call centre actually follows any protocol for escalation, and from what I've seen, they tell everyone they've ""escalated"" with no indication they've actually done so, unless the case is exceptional. The hotline is intended to take your money and fob you off.

Realistically, you should be prepared to pay for a faster service if you have to be in the UK at a certain time. Please remember to apply as early in advance as possible (usually 3 months for most visas).",0.816,0.816,0.816,0.816,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1598ega/reminder_student_visa_season_affects_all_visa/,07/25/2023,18:21:30,clever_octopus,26,

Johnson & Johnson,products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion?,"products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion? hi IMAM!! this is my first post :) i’m fairly new to the indie world but have always loved fragrances! 

this may be a weirdly specific request but i figured this would be the right place to ask lol! johnson & johnson’s bedtime lotion is such a comforting and nostalgic scent to me, but i’d much rather support a small niche/indie brand than a big corporation like them. i’d love any perfume suggestions you may have, as well as soaps/lotions/body oils or even linen sprays/home fragrances. 

their website describes it as “floral/powdery” and these are the notes: 
“Our Bedtime® lotion fragrance blends a trio of florals: lily of the valley, jasmine blossom and pink rose petals, which are woven by watery ivy and juicy apricot. Fresh top notes rest on a calming and comforting blanket of precious amber, soft musks and an exclusive warm milk note.” 

i find that most cosy/bedtime- type scents usually center lavender and vanilla and sometimes more sugary notes, and i love that this one doesn’t actually include any those and isn’t too sweet— i find it fresh and soft and lovely :) 

doesn’t have to be a “dupe” per se but would love to hear any suggestions of products in this wheelhouse! also open to ones that are similar to [other johnson’s baby product fragrances](https://www.johnsonsbaby.com/purpose-standards/ingredients/scents-fragrance)

Johnson & Johnson,JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT,"JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT Next Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson is planning to renew their patent on Bedaquiline, a Tuberculosis (TB)  medication. This will keep the price of this medication high, since only J&J will be able to manufacture it, preventing millions of people in lower income countries from affording this medication. 

TB is entirely treatable, yet it kills more than 1,500,000 people a year due to the unaffordability of medication. Again it is ENTIRELY TREATABLE, but J&J’s patent currently prevents manufacturers around the world to distribute Bedaquiline to those in need. 

HOWEVER, this patent expired today, and if a large enough voice expresses dissent towards J&J’s plan to renew the patent, we can stop them from doing so. I’ve attached all the links you need to reach J&J in the comments. The company itself is not some evil force. Its made up of people who probably think they are doing the right thing. They arent. And we have to let them know that. 

As a consumer you have a certain power in the products you choose to buy. I encourage you to find other alternatives to J&J products, including Listerine, if they go through with this patent.

Johnson & Johnson,Johnson & Johnson Reaches Deal for $8.9 Billion Talc Settlement,"Johnson & Johnson Reaches Deal for $8.9 Billion Talc Settlement Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday that it had agreed to pay $8.9 billion to tens of thousands of people who claimed the company’s talcum powder products caused cancer, a proposal that lawyers for the plaintiffs called a “significant victory” in a legal fight that has lasted more than a decade.

The proposed settlement would be paid out over 25 years through a subsidiary, which filed for bankruptcy to enable the $8.9 billion trust, Johnson & Johnson said in a court filing. If a bankruptcy court approves it, the agreement will resolve all current and future claims involving Johnson & Johnson products that contain talc, such as baby powder, the company said.

Johnson & Johnson,Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial,"Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial  

>Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial - Lawyers representing the California man who claims to have suffered rare cancer as a result of exposure to asbestos contained in Johnson and Johnson's (JNJ.N) baby powder made of talc on Monday urged a juror to make the company pay hefty punitive damages the company's conduct as reckless as well as ""despicable.""

&#x200B;

[heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc ](https://preview.redd.it/az635o7456db1.jpg?width=1173&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e045838470196163a8f6a6dc76b51c8881f355a5)

A prudent company would not market an item that allows carcinogens to be injected into infants,” Joseph Satterley, an attorney for Emory Hernandez Valadez, said in his closing argument after a six-week trial at Alameda County Superior Court in California.

J&J has always denied that the discontinued powder has asbestos or can cause cancer.

Satterley demanded that jurors give Hernandez punitive damages around nine times more than compensatory damages. These include $3.8 million for medical expenses and compensation for suffering and pain. Satterley claimed that the damages for pain and suffering should be far greater than the medical expenses.

The Supreme Court has decided that punitive damages should typically not exceed nine times compensatory damages and that a more excellent ratio may be reduced upon appeal as excessive.

J&J’s lawyers told jurors on Monday that there was no evidence linking Hernandez’s cancer with talc at trial. They also said that the company has always tried to test Talc’s properties and ensure its safety.

“What is most remarkable about the party with the burden of proof that they did not examine any bottles (he) says he used,” asbestos attorney Allison Brown said.

When the plaintiff’s doctor examined for evidence of asbestos in his body, they declared, “They found none – not a single asbestos fiber.”

The jury is expected to start deliberations on Tuesday.

Hernandez, who is 24, claimed in his suit that he was diagnosed with mesothelioma within the heart’s tissue due to exposure to J&J’s products for talc from the time as a child.

Thousands of plaintiffs have commenced lawsuits and alleged that J&J’s baby powder and other talc-based products may contain asbestos, which caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&J has claimed that its Talc powders are not harmful and don’t contain asbestos that has been linked to mesothelioma.

In April, J&J company subsidiary LTL Management [filed for bankruptcy](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/jjs-8-9-billion-talc-settlement-faces-us-bankruptcy-test/) in Trenton, New Jersey; it proposed that it pay $8.9 billion to resolve the more than 38,000 lawsuits and keep new ones from arising. It was the second attempt at settling the claims involving talc in bankruptcy following the U.S. appeals court ruling against an earlier offer.

The majority of litigation has been stopped in bankruptcy proceedings. However, U.S. Chief Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan, who is in charge of the LTL’s Chapter 11, let Hernandez’s trial go because he’s likely to survive only briefly.

Asbestos plaintiffs want to have LTL’s recent bankruptcy filing thrown out. They’ve argued that the filing was made in bad good faith to protect LTL from lawsuits.

J&J and LTL have claimed that bankruptcy provides settlement payments to plaintiffs fairer efficiently, effectively and relatively than trial courts. The latter have compared to a “lottery” where some litigants are awarded large amounts of money, while others get nothing.

J&J declared it was filing bankruptcy court papers that expenses of its talc-related court verdicts settlements, legal fees and settlements are estimated at [$4.5 billion](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/johnson-johnson-to-pay-8-9-billion-to-settle-talcum-powder-cancer-claims/).

As Johnson & Johnson is acutely aware, roughly 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis in 2021. The World Health Organization noted that ""Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries."" For regions like the Dominican Republic of the Congo, that statistic results in over 40,000 HIV-negative deaths annually--almost all of which could be prevented if it weren't for the financial burden upheld by the cost of Bedaquiline. Johnson & Johnson's profits have proliferated massively from the life-saving medication Bedaquiline--and that's a largely deserved consequence of assisting such a noble cause. That said, their profits have continued for two decades. These earnings have sustained for an exceedingly generous duration, and it's time to re-embrace J&J's cooperate credo: ""We believe our first responsibility is to the patients"" and that ""we must constantly strive to provide value, reduce our cost and maintain reasonable prices."" The latter half of this quote is where my largest concern lies. As J&J has noted, Bedaquiline costs between $340 to $400 for six months of treatment in low-income countries. Problematically, though, the average annual income in the DRC is $449. This price is unnecessarily exorbitant and directly contradicts this company's core values. Attempting to renew the 2007 Bedaquiline patent is utterly superfluous, and display's a direct responsibility to J&J's shareholders perpetually above the lives of millions who are each objectively equal in value to these investors.

As J&J is keenly conscious of, TB treatment costs will be lowered by as much as 67% if a generic version is allowed to enter the market. Given that J&J has undeniably fulfilled their financial incentives where, as stated in their credo, ""business partners must have an opportunity to make a fair profit,"" it is more than reasonable to expect the Bedaquiline patent to expire in the coming weeks. This final point is further bolstered when juxtaposed with the reality that an overwhelming majority of the research funding for Bedaquiline came from taxpayer money. Like most drugs in the last quarter century, Bedaquiline was financed by the people, patented by a corporation, and profited on by that entity for decades. J&J's services toward curing TB have been lavishly repaid in quantities exceeding their total investments by orders of magnitude; it's time to give back what always belonged to the people.

Without dismissing the realities mentioned above, it would be unreasonable to solely blame J&J for wanting to profit in a system that incentivizes revenue over ethics. However, it is entirely fair to scorn them ad nauseam for attempting to exploit this system to prolong their grossly inflated profits. While the healthcare sector J&J is a component of consistently emboldens revenue-centered practices, J&J's actions reflect a willingness to act as a martyr for maintaining this greed-driven catastrophe.

Without question, it's time for the Bedaquiline patent to expire. Any further attempts to delay this irrefutably equitable process directly and deplorably contradicts J&J's credo and will result in the boycotting of all J&J products until their decision is promptly reversed.

By securing a patent for Bedaquiline, J&J has generated revenue in the billions. The cost of a renewed patent, however, will total the lives of six million.

Johnson & Johnson,products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion?,"products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion? hi IMAM!! this is my first post :) i’m fairly new to the indie world but have always loved fragrances! 

this may be a weirdly specific request but i figured this would be the right place to ask lol! johnson & johnson’s bedtime lotion is such a comforting and nostalgic scent to me, but i’d much rather support a small niche/indie brand than a big corporation like them. i’d love any perfume suggestions you may have, as well as soaps/lotions/body oils or even linen sprays/home fragrances. 

their website describes it as “floral/powdery” and these are the notes: 
“Our Bedtime® lotion fragrance blends a trio of florals: lily of the valley, jasmine blossom and pink rose petals, which are woven by watery ivy and juicy apricot. Fresh top notes rest on a calming and comforting blanket of precious amber, soft musks and an exclusive warm milk note.” 

i find that most cosy/bedtime- type scents usually center lavender and vanilla and sometimes more sugary notes, and i love that this one doesn’t actually include any those and isn’t too sweet— i find it fresh and soft and lovely :) 

doesn’t have to be a “dupe” per se but would love to hear any suggestions of products in this wheelhouse! also open to ones that are similar to [other johnson’s baby product fragrances](https://www.johnsonsbaby.com/purpose-standards/ingredients/scents-fragrance)

Johnson & Johnson,JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT,"JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT Next Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson is planning to renew their patent on Bedaquiline, a Tuberculosis (TB)  medication. This will keep the price of this medication high, since only J&J will be able to manufacture it, preventing millions of people in lower income countries from affording this medication. 

TB is entirely treatable, yet it kills more than 1,500,000 people a year due to the unaffordability of medication. Again it is ENTIRELY TREATABLE, but J&J’s patent currently prevents manufacturers around the world to distribute Bedaquiline to those in need. 

HOWEVER, this patent expired today, and if a large enough voice expresses dissent towards J&J’s plan to renew the patent, we can stop them from doing so. I’ve attached all the links you need to reach J&J in the comments. The company itself is not some evil force. Its made up of people who probably think they are doing the right thing. They arent. And we have to let them know that. 

As a consumer you have a certain power in the products you choose to buy. I encourage you to find other alternatives to J&J products, including Listerine, if they go through with this patent.

The proposed settlement would be paid out over 25 years through a subsidiary, which filed for bankruptcy to enable the $8.9 billion trust, Johnson & Johnson said in a court filing. If a bankruptcy court approves it, the agreement will resolve all current and future claims involving Johnson & Johnson products that contain talc, such as baby powder, the company said.

Johnson & Johnson,Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial,"Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial  

>Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial - Lawyers representing the California man who claims to have suffered rare cancer as a result of exposure to asbestos contained in Johnson and Johnson's (JNJ.N) baby powder made of talc on Monday urged a juror to make the company pay hefty punitive damages the company's conduct as reckless as well as ""despicable.""

&#x200B;

[heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc ](https://preview.redd.it/az635o7456db1.jpg?width=1173&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e045838470196163a8f6a6dc76b51c8881f355a5)

A prudent company would not market an item that allows carcinogens to be injected into infants,” Joseph Satterley, an attorney for Emory Hernandez Valadez, said in his closing argument after a six-week trial at Alameda County Superior Court in California.

J&J has always denied that the discontinued powder has asbestos or can cause cancer.

Satterley demanded that jurors give Hernandez punitive damages around nine times more than compensatory damages. These include $3.8 million for medical expenses and compensation for suffering and pain. Satterley claimed that the damages for pain and suffering should be far greater than the medical expenses.

The Supreme Court has decided that punitive damages should typically not exceed nine times compensatory damages and that a more excellent ratio may be reduced upon appeal as excessive.

J&J’s lawyers told jurors on Monday that there was no evidence linking Hernandez’s cancer with talc at trial. They also said that the company has always tried to test Talc’s properties and ensure its safety.

“What is most remarkable about the party with the burden of proof that they did not examine any bottles (he) says he used,” asbestos attorney Allison Brown said.

When the plaintiff’s doctor examined for evidence of asbestos in his body, they declared, “They found none – not a single asbestos fiber.”

The jury is expected to start deliberations on Tuesday.

Hernandez, who is 24, claimed in his suit that he was diagnosed with mesothelioma within the heart’s tissue due to exposure to J&J’s products for talc from the time as a child.

Thousands of plaintiffs have commenced lawsuits and alleged that J&J’s baby powder and other talc-based products may contain asbestos, which caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&J has claimed that its Talc powders are not harmful and don’t contain asbestos that has been linked to mesothelioma.

In April, J&J company subsidiary LTL Management [filed for bankruptcy](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/jjs-8-9-billion-talc-settlement-faces-us-bankruptcy-test/) in Trenton, New Jersey; it proposed that it pay $8.9 billion to resolve the more than 38,000 lawsuits and keep new ones from arising. It was the second attempt at settling the claims involving talc in bankruptcy following the U.S. appeals court ruling against an earlier offer.

The majority of litigation has been stopped in bankruptcy proceedings. However, U.S. Chief Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan, who is in charge of the LTL’s Chapter 11, let Hernandez’s trial go because he’s likely to survive only briefly.

Asbestos plaintiffs want to have LTL’s recent bankruptcy filing thrown out. They’ve argued that the filing was made in bad good faith to protect LTL from lawsuits.

J&J and LTL have claimed that bankruptcy provides settlement payments to plaintiffs fairer efficiently, effectively and relatively than trial courts. The latter have compared to a “lottery” where some litigants are awarded large amounts of money, while others get nothing.

J&J declared it was filing bankruptcy court papers that expenses of its talc-related court verdicts settlements, legal fees and settlements are estimated at [$4.5 billion](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/johnson-johnson-to-pay-8-9-billion-to-settle-talcum-powder-cancer-claims/).

As Johnson & Johnson is acutely aware, roughly 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis in 2021. The World Health Organization noted that ""Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries."" For regions like the Dominican Republic of the Congo, that statistic results in over 40,000 HIV-negative deaths annually--almost all of which could be prevented if it weren't for the financial burden upheld by the cost of Bedaquiline. Johnson & Johnson's profits have proliferated massively from the life-saving medication Bedaquiline--and that's a largely deserved consequence of assisting such a noble cause. That said, their profits have continued for two decades. These earnings have sustained for an exceedingly generous duration, and it's time to re-embrace J&J's cooperate credo: ""We believe our first responsibility is to the patients"" and that ""we must constantly strive to provide value, reduce our cost and maintain reasonable prices."" The latter half of this quote is where my largest concern lies. As J&J has noted, Bedaquiline costs between $340 to $400 for six months of treatment in low-income countries. Problematically, though, the average annual income in the DRC is $449. This price is unnecessarily exorbitant and directly contradicts this company's core values. Attempting to renew the 2007 Bedaquiline patent is utterly superfluous, and display's a direct responsibility to J&J's shareholders perpetually above the lives of millions who are each objectively equal in value to these investors.

As J&J is keenly conscious of, TB treatment costs will be lowered by as much as 67% if a generic version is allowed to enter the market. Given that J&J has undeniably fulfilled their financial incentives where, as stated in their credo, ""business partners must have an opportunity to make a fair profit,"" it is more than reasonable to expect the Bedaquiline patent to expire in the coming weeks. This final point is further bolstered when juxtaposed with the reality that an overwhelming majority of the research funding for Bedaquiline came from taxpayer money. Like most drugs in the last quarter century, Bedaquiline was financed by the people, patented by a corporation, and profited on by that entity for decades. J&J's services toward curing TB have been lavishly repaid in quantities exceeding their total investments by orders of magnitude; it's time to give back what always belonged to the people.

Without dismissing the realities mentioned above, it would be unreasonable to solely blame J&J for wanting to profit in a system that incentivizes revenue over ethics. However, it is entirely fair to scorn them ad nauseam for attempting to exploit this system to prolong their grossly inflated profits. While the healthcare sector J&J is a component of consistently emboldens revenue-centered practices, J&J's actions reflect a willingness to act as a martyr for maintaining this greed-driven catastrophe.

Without question, it's time for the Bedaquiline patent to expire. Any further attempts to delay this irrefutably equitable process directly and deplorably contradicts J&J's credo and will result in the boycotting of all J&J products until their decision is promptly reversed.

By securing a patent for Bedaquiline, J&J has generated revenue in the billions. The cost of a renewed patent, however, will total the lives of six million.

Johnson & Johnson,products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion?,"products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion? hi IMAM!! this is my first post :) i’m fairly new to the indie world but have always loved fragrances! 

this may be a weirdly specific request but i figured this would be the right place to ask lol! johnson & johnson’s bedtime lotion is such a comforting and nostalgic scent to me, but i’d much rather support a small niche/indie brand than a big corporation like them. i’d love any perfume suggestions you may have, as well as soaps/lotions/body oils or even linen sprays/home fragrances. 

their website describes it as “floral/powdery” and these are the notes: 
“Our Bedtime® lotion fragrance blends a trio of florals: lily of the valley, jasmine blossom and pink rose petals, which are woven by watery ivy and juicy apricot. Fresh top notes rest on a calming and comforting blanket of precious amber, soft musks and an exclusive warm milk note.” 

i find that most cosy/bedtime- type scents usually center lavender and vanilla and sometimes more sugary notes, and i love that this one doesn’t actually include any those and isn’t too sweet— i find it fresh and soft and lovely :) 

doesn’t have to be a “dupe” per se but would love to hear any suggestions of products in this wheelhouse! also open to ones that are similar to [other johnson’s baby product fragrances](https://www.johnsonsbaby.com/purpose-standards/ingredients/scents-fragrance)

Johnson & Johnson,JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT,"JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT Next Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson is planning to renew their patent on Bedaquiline, a Tuberculosis (TB)  medication. This will keep the price of this medication high, since only J&J will be able to manufacture it, preventing millions of people in lower income countries from affording this medication. 

TB is entirely treatable, yet it kills more than 1,500,000 people a year due to the unaffordability of medication. Again it is ENTIRELY TREATABLE, but J&J’s patent currently prevents manufacturers around the world to distribute Bedaquiline to those in need. 

HOWEVER, this patent expired today, and if a large enough voice expresses dissent towards J&J’s plan to renew the patent, we can stop them from doing so. I’ve attached all the links you need to reach J&J in the comments. The company itself is not some evil force. Its made up of people who probably think they are doing the right thing. They arent. And we have to let them know that. 

As a consumer you have a certain power in the products you choose to buy. I encourage you to find other alternatives to J&J products, including Listerine, if they go through with this patent.

Johnson & Johnson,Johnson & Johnson Reaches Deal for $8.9 Billion Talc Settlement,"Johnson & Johnson Reaches Deal for $8.9 Billion Talc Settlement Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday that it had agreed to pay $8.9 billion to tens of thousands of people who claimed the company’s talcum powder products caused cancer, a proposal that lawyers for the plaintiffs called a “significant victory” in a legal fight that has lasted more than a decade.

The proposed settlement would be paid out over 25 years through a subsidiary, which filed for bankruptcy to enable the $8.9 billion trust, Johnson & Johnson said in a court filing. If a bankruptcy court approves it, the agreement will resolve all current and future claims involving Johnson & Johnson products that contain talc, such as baby powder, the company said.

Johnson & Johnson,Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial,"Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial  

>Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial - Lawyers representing the California man who claims to have suffered rare cancer as a result of exposure to asbestos contained in Johnson and Johnson's (JNJ.N) baby powder made of talc on Monday urged a juror to make the company pay hefty punitive damages the company's conduct as reckless as well as ""despicable.""

&#x200B;

[heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc ](https://preview.redd.it/az635o7456db1.jpg?width=1173&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e045838470196163a8f6a6dc76b51c8881f355a5)

A prudent company would not market an item that allows carcinogens to be injected into infants,” Joseph Satterley, an attorney for Emory Hernandez Valadez, said in his closing argument after a six-week trial at Alameda County Superior Court in California.

J&J has always denied that the discontinued powder has asbestos or can cause cancer.

Satterley demanded that jurors give Hernandez punitive damages around nine times more than compensatory damages. These include $3.8 million for medical expenses and compensation for suffering and pain. Satterley claimed that the damages for pain and suffering should be far greater than the medical expenses.

The Supreme Court has decided that punitive damages should typically not exceed nine times compensatory damages and that a more excellent ratio may be reduced upon appeal as excessive.

J&J’s lawyers told jurors on Monday that there was no evidence linking Hernandez’s cancer with talc at trial. They also said that the company has always tried to test Talc’s properties and ensure its safety.

“What is most remarkable about the party with the burden of proof that they did not examine any bottles (he) says he used,” asbestos attorney Allison Brown said.

When the plaintiff’s doctor examined for evidence of asbestos in his body, they declared, “They found none – not a single asbestos fiber.”

The jury is expected to start deliberations on Tuesday.

Hernandez, who is 24, claimed in his suit that he was diagnosed with mesothelioma within the heart’s tissue due to exposure to J&J’s products for talc from the time as a child.

Thousands of plaintiffs have commenced lawsuits and alleged that J&J’s baby powder and other talc-based products may contain asbestos, which caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&J has claimed that its Talc powders are not harmful and don’t contain asbestos that has been linked to mesothelioma.

In April, J&J company subsidiary LTL Management [filed for bankruptcy](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/jjs-8-9-billion-talc-settlement-faces-us-bankruptcy-test/) in Trenton, New Jersey; it proposed that it pay $8.9 billion to resolve the more than 38,000 lawsuits and keep new ones from arising. It was the second attempt at settling the claims involving talc in bankruptcy following the U.S. appeals court ruling against an earlier offer.

The majority of litigation has been stopped in bankruptcy proceedings. However, U.S. Chief Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan, who is in charge of the LTL’s Chapter 11, let Hernandez’s trial go because he’s likely to survive only briefly.

Asbestos plaintiffs want to have LTL’s recent bankruptcy filing thrown out. They’ve argued that the filing was made in bad good faith to protect LTL from lawsuits.

J&J and LTL have claimed that bankruptcy provides settlement payments to plaintiffs fairer efficiently, effectively and relatively than trial courts. The latter have compared to a “lottery” where some litigants are awarded large amounts of money, while others get nothing.

J&J declared it was filing bankruptcy court papers that expenses of its talc-related court verdicts settlements, legal fees and settlements are estimated at [$4.5 billion](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/johnson-johnson-to-pay-8-9-billion-to-settle-talcum-powder-cancer-claims/).

As Johnson & Johnson is acutely aware, roughly 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis in 2021. The World Health Organization noted that ""Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries."" For regions like the Dominican Republic of the Congo, that statistic results in over 40,000 HIV-negative deaths annually--almost all of which could be prevented if it weren't for the financial burden upheld by the cost of Bedaquiline. Johnson & Johnson's profits have proliferated massively from the life-saving medication Bedaquiline--and that's a largely deserved consequence of assisting such a noble cause. That said, their profits have continued for two decades. These earnings have sustained for an exceedingly generous duration, and it's time to re-embrace J&J's cooperate credo: ""We believe our first responsibility is to the patients"" and that ""we must constantly strive to provide value, reduce our cost and maintain reasonable prices."" The latter half of this quote is where my largest concern lies. As J&J has noted, Bedaquiline costs between $340 to $400 for six months of treatment in low-income countries. Problematically, though, the average annual income in the DRC is $449. This price is unnecessarily exorbitant and directly contradicts this company's core values. Attempting to renew the 2007 Bedaquiline patent is utterly superfluous, and display's a direct responsibility to J&J's shareholders perpetually above the lives of millions who are each objectively equal in value to these investors.

As J&J is keenly conscious of, TB treatment costs will be lowered by as much as 67% if a generic version is allowed to enter the market. Given that J&J has undeniably fulfilled their financial incentives where, as stated in their credo, ""business partners must have an opportunity to make a fair profit,"" it is more than reasonable to expect the Bedaquiline patent to expire in the coming weeks. This final point is further bolstered when juxtaposed with the reality that an overwhelming majority of the research funding for Bedaquiline came from taxpayer money. Like most drugs in the last quarter century, Bedaquiline was financed by the people, patented by a corporation, and profited on by that entity for decades. J&J's services toward curing TB have been lavishly repaid in quantities exceeding their total investments by orders of magnitude; it's time to give back what always belonged to the people.

Without dismissing the realities mentioned above, it would be unreasonable to solely blame J&J for wanting to profit in a system that incentivizes revenue over ethics. However, it is entirely fair to scorn them ad nauseam for attempting to exploit this system to prolong their grossly inflated profits. While the healthcare sector J&J is a component of consistently emboldens revenue-centered practices, J&J's actions reflect a willingness to act as a martyr for maintaining this greed-driven catastrophe.

Without question, it's time for the Bedaquiline patent to expire. Any further attempts to delay this irrefutably equitable process directly and deplorably contradicts J&J's credo and will result in the boycotting of all J&J products until their decision is promptly reversed.

By securing a patent for Bedaquiline, J&J has generated revenue in the billions. The cost of a renewed patent, however, will total the lives of six million.

Johnson & Johnson,products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion?,"products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion? hi IMAM!! this is my first post :) i’m fairly new to the indie world but have always loved fragrances! 

this may be a weirdly specific request but i figured this would be the right place to ask lol! johnson & johnson’s bedtime lotion is such a comforting and nostalgic scent to me, but i’d much rather support a small niche/indie brand than a big corporation like them. i’d love any perfume suggestions you may have, as well as soaps/lotions/body oils or even linen sprays/home fragrances. 

their website describes it as “floral/powdery” and these are the notes: 
“Our Bedtime® lotion fragrance blends a trio of florals: lily of the valley, jasmine blossom and pink rose petals, which are woven by watery ivy and juicy apricot. Fresh top notes rest on a calming and comforting blanket of precious amber, soft musks and an exclusive warm milk note.” 

i find that most cosy/bedtime- type scents usually center lavender and vanilla and sometimes more sugary notes, and i love that this one doesn’t actually include any those and isn’t too sweet— i find it fresh and soft and lovely :) 

doesn’t have to be a “dupe” per se but would love to hear any suggestions of products in this wheelhouse! also open to ones that are similar to [other johnson’s baby product fragrances](https://www.johnsonsbaby.com/purpose-standards/ingredients/scents-fragrance)

Johnson & Johnson,JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT,"JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT Next Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson is planning to renew their patent on Bedaquiline, a Tuberculosis (TB)  medication. This will keep the price of this medication high, since only J&J will be able to manufacture it, preventing millions of people in lower income countries from affording this medication. 

TB is entirely treatable, yet it kills more than 1,500,000 people a year due to the unaffordability of medication. Again it is ENTIRELY TREATABLE, but J&J’s patent currently prevents manufacturers around the world to distribute Bedaquiline to those in need. 

HOWEVER, this patent expired today, and if a large enough voice expresses dissent towards J&J’s plan to renew the patent, we can stop them from doing so. I’ve attached all the links you need to reach J&J in the comments. The company itself is not some evil force. Its made up of people who probably think they are doing the right thing. They arent. And we have to let them know that. 

As a consumer you have a certain power in the products you choose to buy. I encourage you to find other alternatives to J&J products, including Listerine, if they go through with this patent.

The proposed settlement would be paid out over 25 years through a subsidiary, which filed for bankruptcy to enable the $8.9 billion trust, Johnson & Johnson said in a court filing. If a bankruptcy court approves it, the agreement will resolve all current and future claims involving Johnson & Johnson products that contain talc, such as baby powder, the company said.

Johnson & Johnson,Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial,"Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial  

>Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial - Lawyers representing the California man who claims to have suffered rare cancer as a result of exposure to asbestos contained in Johnson and Johnson's (JNJ.N) baby powder made of talc on Monday urged a juror to make the company pay hefty punitive damages the company's conduct as reckless as well as ""despicable.""

&#x200B;

[heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc ](https://preview.redd.it/az635o7456db1.jpg?width=1173&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e045838470196163a8f6a6dc76b51c8881f355a5)

A prudent company would not market an item that allows carcinogens to be injected into infants,” Joseph Satterley, an attorney for Emory Hernandez Valadez, said in his closing argument after a six-week trial at Alameda County Superior Court in California.

J&J has always denied that the discontinued powder has asbestos or can cause cancer.

Satterley demanded that jurors give Hernandez punitive damages around nine times more than compensatory damages. These include $3.8 million for medical expenses and compensation for suffering and pain. Satterley claimed that the damages for pain and suffering should be far greater than the medical expenses.

The Supreme Court has decided that punitive damages should typically not exceed nine times compensatory damages and that a more excellent ratio may be reduced upon appeal as excessive.

J&J’s lawyers told jurors on Monday that there was no evidence linking Hernandez’s cancer with talc at trial. They also said that the company has always tried to test Talc’s properties and ensure its safety.

“What is most remarkable about the party with the burden of proof that they did not examine any bottles (he) says he used,” asbestos attorney Allison Brown said.

When the plaintiff’s doctor examined for evidence of asbestos in his body, they declared, “They found none – not a single asbestos fiber.”

The jury is expected to start deliberations on Tuesday.

Hernandez, who is 24, claimed in his suit that he was diagnosed with mesothelioma within the heart’s tissue due to exposure to J&J’s products for talc from the time as a child.

Thousands of plaintiffs have commenced lawsuits and alleged that J&J’s baby powder and other talc-based products may contain asbestos, which caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&J has claimed that its Talc powders are not harmful and don’t contain asbestos that has been linked to mesothelioma.

In April, J&J company subsidiary LTL Management [filed for bankruptcy](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/jjs-8-9-billion-talc-settlement-faces-us-bankruptcy-test/) in Trenton, New Jersey; it proposed that it pay $8.9 billion to resolve the more than 38,000 lawsuits and keep new ones from arising. It was the second attempt at settling the claims involving talc in bankruptcy following the U.S. appeals court ruling against an earlier offer.

The majority of litigation has been stopped in bankruptcy proceedings. However, U.S. Chief Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan, who is in charge of the LTL’s Chapter 11, let Hernandez’s trial go because he’s likely to survive only briefly.

Asbestos plaintiffs want to have LTL’s recent bankruptcy filing thrown out. They’ve argued that the filing was made in bad good faith to protect LTL from lawsuits.

J&J and LTL have claimed that bankruptcy provides settlement payments to plaintiffs fairer efficiently, effectively and relatively than trial courts. The latter have compared to a “lottery” where some litigants are awarded large amounts of money, while others get nothing.

J&J declared it was filing bankruptcy court papers that expenses of its talc-related court verdicts settlements, legal fees and settlements are estimated at [$4.5 billion](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/johnson-johnson-to-pay-8-9-billion-to-settle-talcum-powder-cancer-claims/).

As Johnson & Johnson is acutely aware, roughly 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis in 2021. The World Health Organization noted that ""Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries."" For regions like the Dominican Republic of the Congo, that statistic results in over 40,000 HIV-negative deaths annually--almost all of which could be prevented if it weren't for the financial burden upheld by the cost of Bedaquiline. Johnson & Johnson's profits have proliferated massively from the life-saving medication Bedaquiline--and that's a largely deserved consequence of assisting such a noble cause. That said, their profits have continued for two decades. These earnings have sustained for an exceedingly generous duration, and it's time to re-embrace J&J's cooperate credo: ""We believe our first responsibility is to the patients"" and that ""we must constantly strive to provide value, reduce our cost and maintain reasonable prices."" The latter half of this quote is where my largest concern lies. As J&J has noted, Bedaquiline costs between $340 to $400 for six months of treatment in low-income countries. Problematically, though, the average annual income in the DRC is $449. This price is unnecessarily exorbitant and directly contradicts this company's core values. Attempting to renew the 2007 Bedaquiline patent is utterly superfluous, and display's a direct responsibility to J&J's shareholders perpetually above the lives of millions who are each objectively equal in value to these investors.

As J&J is keenly conscious of, TB treatment costs will be lowered by as much as 67% if a generic version is allowed to enter the market. Given that J&J has undeniably fulfilled their financial incentives where, as stated in their credo, ""business partners must have an opportunity to make a fair profit,"" it is more than reasonable to expect the Bedaquiline patent to expire in the coming weeks. This final point is further bolstered when juxtaposed with the reality that an overwhelming majority of the research funding for Bedaquiline came from taxpayer money. Like most drugs in the last quarter century, Bedaquiline was financed by the people, patented by a corporation, and profited on by that entity for decades. J&J's services toward curing TB have been lavishly repaid in quantities exceeding their total investments by orders of magnitude; it's time to give back what always belonged to the people.

Without dismissing the realities mentioned above, it would be unreasonable to solely blame J&J for wanting to profit in a system that incentivizes revenue over ethics. However, it is entirely fair to scorn them ad nauseam for attempting to exploit this system to prolong their grossly inflated profits. While the healthcare sector J&J is a component of consistently emboldens revenue-centered practices, J&J's actions reflect a willingness to act as a martyr for maintaining this greed-driven catastrophe.

Without question, it's time for the Bedaquiline patent to expire. Any further attempts to delay this irrefutably equitable process directly and deplorably contradicts J&J's credo and will result in the boycotting of all J&J products until their decision is promptly reversed.

By securing a patent for Bedaquiline, J&J has generated revenue in the billions. The cost of a renewed patent, however, will total the lives of six million.

Johnson & Johnson,products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion?,"products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion? hi IMAM!! this is my first post :) i’m fairly new to the indie world but have always loved fragrances! 

this may be a weirdly specific request but i figured this would be the right place to ask lol! johnson & johnson’s bedtime lotion is such a comforting and nostalgic scent to me, but i’d much rather support a small niche/indie brand than a big corporation like them. i’d love any perfume suggestions you may have, as well as soaps/lotions/body oils or even linen sprays/home fragrances. 

their website describes it as “floral/powdery” and these are the notes: 
“Our Bedtime® lotion fragrance blends a trio of florals: lily of the valley, jasmine blossom and pink rose petals, which are woven by watery ivy and juicy apricot. Fresh top notes rest on a calming and comforting blanket of precious amber, soft musks and an exclusive warm milk note.” 

i find that most cosy/bedtime- type scents usually center lavender and vanilla and sometimes more sugary notes, and i love that this one doesn’t actually include any those and isn’t too sweet— i find it fresh and soft and lovely :) 

doesn’t have to be a “dupe” per se but would love to hear any suggestions of products in this wheelhouse! also open to ones that are similar to [other johnson’s baby product fragrances](https://www.johnsonsbaby.com/purpose-standards/ingredients/scents-fragrance)

Johnson & Johnson,JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT,"JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT Next Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson is planning to renew their patent on Bedaquiline, a Tuberculosis (TB)  medication. This will keep the price of this medication high, since only J&J will be able to manufacture it, preventing millions of people in lower income countries from affording this medication. 

TB is entirely treatable, yet it kills more than 1,500,000 people a year due to the unaffordability of medication. Again it is ENTIRELY TREATABLE, but J&J’s patent currently prevents manufacturers around the world to distribute Bedaquiline to those in need. 

HOWEVER, this patent expired today, and if a large enough voice expresses dissent towards J&J’s plan to renew the patent, we can stop them from doing so. I’ve attached all the links you need to reach J&J in the comments. The company itself is not some evil force. Its made up of people who probably think they are doing the right thing. They arent. And we have to let them know that. 

As a consumer you have a certain power in the products you choose to buy. I encourage you to find other alternatives to J&J products, including Listerine, if they go through with this patent.

Johnson & Johnson,Johnson & Johnson Reaches Deal for $8.9 Billion Talc Settlement,"Johnson & Johnson Reaches Deal for $8.9 Billion Talc Settlement Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday that it had agreed to pay $8.9 billion to tens of thousands of people who claimed the company’s talcum powder products caused cancer, a proposal that lawyers for the plaintiffs called a “significant victory” in a legal fight that has lasted more than a decade.

The proposed settlement would be paid out over 25 years through a subsidiary, which filed for bankruptcy to enable the $8.9 billion trust, Johnson & Johnson said in a court filing. If a bankruptcy court approves it, the agreement will resolve all current and future claims involving Johnson & Johnson products that contain talc, such as baby powder, the company said.

Johnson & Johnson,Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial,"Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial  

>Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial - Lawyers representing the California man who claims to have suffered rare cancer as a result of exposure to asbestos contained in Johnson and Johnson's (JNJ.N) baby powder made of talc on Monday urged a juror to make the company pay hefty punitive damages the company's conduct as reckless as well as ""despicable.""

&#x200B;

[heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc ](https://preview.redd.it/az635o7456db1.jpg?width=1173&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e045838470196163a8f6a6dc76b51c8881f355a5)

A prudent company would not market an item that allows carcinogens to be injected into infants,” Joseph Satterley, an attorney for Emory Hernandez Valadez, said in his closing argument after a six-week trial at Alameda County Superior Court in California.

J&J has always denied that the discontinued powder has asbestos or can cause cancer.

Satterley demanded that jurors give Hernandez punitive damages around nine times more than compensatory damages. These include $3.8 million for medical expenses and compensation for suffering and pain. Satterley claimed that the damages for pain and suffering should be far greater than the medical expenses.

The Supreme Court has decided that punitive damages should typically not exceed nine times compensatory damages and that a more excellent ratio may be reduced upon appeal as excessive.

J&J’s lawyers told jurors on Monday that there was no evidence linking Hernandez’s cancer with talc at trial. They also said that the company has always tried to test Talc’s properties and ensure its safety.

“What is most remarkable about the party with the burden of proof that they did not examine any bottles (he) says he used,” asbestos attorney Allison Brown said.

When the plaintiff’s doctor examined for evidence of asbestos in his body, they declared, “They found none – not a single asbestos fiber.”

The jury is expected to start deliberations on Tuesday.

Hernandez, who is 24, claimed in his suit that he was diagnosed with mesothelioma within the heart’s tissue due to exposure to J&J’s products for talc from the time as a child.

Thousands of plaintiffs have commenced lawsuits and alleged that J&J’s baby powder and other talc-based products may contain asbestos, which caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&J has claimed that its Talc powders are not harmful and don’t contain asbestos that has been linked to mesothelioma.

In April, J&J company subsidiary LTL Management [filed for bankruptcy](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/jjs-8-9-billion-talc-settlement-faces-us-bankruptcy-test/) in Trenton, New Jersey; it proposed that it pay $8.9 billion to resolve the more than 38,000 lawsuits and keep new ones from arising. It was the second attempt at settling the claims involving talc in bankruptcy following the U.S. appeals court ruling against an earlier offer.

The majority of litigation has been stopped in bankruptcy proceedings. However, U.S. Chief Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan, who is in charge of the LTL’s Chapter 11, let Hernandez’s trial go because he’s likely to survive only briefly.

Asbestos plaintiffs want to have LTL’s recent bankruptcy filing thrown out. They’ve argued that the filing was made in bad good faith to protect LTL from lawsuits.

J&J and LTL have claimed that bankruptcy provides settlement payments to plaintiffs fairer efficiently, effectively and relatively than trial courts. The latter have compared to a “lottery” where some litigants are awarded large amounts of money, while others get nothing.

J&J declared it was filing bankruptcy court papers that expenses of its talc-related court verdicts settlements, legal fees and settlements are estimated at [$4.5 billion](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/johnson-johnson-to-pay-8-9-billion-to-settle-talcum-powder-cancer-claims/).

As Johnson & Johnson is acutely aware, roughly 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis in 2021. The World Health Organization noted that ""Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries."" For regions like the Dominican Republic of the Congo, that statistic results in over 40,000 HIV-negative deaths annually--almost all of which could be prevented if it weren't for the financial burden upheld by the cost of Bedaquiline. Johnson & Johnson's profits have proliferated massively from the life-saving medication Bedaquiline--and that's a largely deserved consequence of assisting such a noble cause. That said, their profits have continued for two decades. These earnings have sustained for an exceedingly generous duration, and it's time to re-embrace J&J's cooperate credo: ""We believe our first responsibility is to the patients"" and that ""we must constantly strive to provide value, reduce our cost and maintain reasonable prices."" The latter half of this quote is where my largest concern lies. As J&J has noted, Bedaquiline costs between $340 to $400 for six months of treatment in low-income countries. Problematically, though, the average annual income in the DRC is $449. This price is unnecessarily exorbitant and directly contradicts this company's core values. Attempting to renew the 2007 Bedaquiline patent is utterly superfluous, and display's a direct responsibility to J&J's shareholders perpetually above the lives of millions who are each objectively equal in value to these investors.

As J&J is keenly conscious of, TB treatment costs will be lowered by as much as 67% if a generic version is allowed to enter the market. Given that J&J has undeniably fulfilled their financial incentives where, as stated in their credo, ""business partners must have an opportunity to make a fair profit,"" it is more than reasonable to expect the Bedaquiline patent to expire in the coming weeks. This final point is further bolstered when juxtaposed with the reality that an overwhelming majority of the research funding for Bedaquiline came from taxpayer money. Like most drugs in the last quarter century, Bedaquiline was financed by the people, patented by a corporation, and profited on by that entity for decades. J&J's services toward curing TB have been lavishly repaid in quantities exceeding their total investments by orders of magnitude; it's time to give back what always belonged to the people.

Without dismissing the realities mentioned above, it would be unreasonable to solely blame J&J for wanting to profit in a system that incentivizes revenue over ethics. However, it is entirely fair to scorn them ad nauseam for attempting to exploit this system to prolong their grossly inflated profits. While the healthcare sector J&J is a component of consistently emboldens revenue-centered practices, J&J's actions reflect a willingness to act as a martyr for maintaining this greed-driven catastrophe.

Without question, it's time for the Bedaquiline patent to expire. Any further attempts to delay this irrefutably equitable process directly and deplorably contradicts J&J's credo and will result in the boycotting of all J&J products until their decision is promptly reversed.

By securing a patent for Bedaquiline, J&J has generated revenue in the billions. The cost of a renewed patent, however, will total the lives of six million.

Johnson & Johnson,products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion?,"products with a similar fragrance to johnson & johnson’s baby lotion? hi IMAM!! this is my first post :) i’m fairly new to the indie world but have always loved fragrances! 

this may be a weirdly specific request but i figured this would be the right place to ask lol! johnson & johnson’s bedtime lotion is such a comforting and nostalgic scent to me, but i’d much rather support a small niche/indie brand than a big corporation like them. i’d love any perfume suggestions you may have, as well as soaps/lotions/body oils or even linen sprays/home fragrances. 

their website describes it as “floral/powdery” and these are the notes: 
“Our Bedtime® lotion fragrance blends a trio of florals: lily of the valley, jasmine blossom and pink rose petals, which are woven by watery ivy and juicy apricot. Fresh top notes rest on a calming and comforting blanket of precious amber, soft musks and an exclusive warm milk note.” 

i find that most cosy/bedtime- type scents usually center lavender and vanilla and sometimes more sugary notes, and i love that this one doesn’t actually include any those and isn’t too sweet— i find it fresh and soft and lovely :) 

doesn’t have to be a “dupe” per se but would love to hear any suggestions of products in this wheelhouse! also open to ones that are similar to [other johnson’s baby product fragrances](https://www.johnsonsbaby.com/purpose-standards/ingredients/scents-fragrance)

Johnson & Johnson,JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT,"JOHNSON & JOHNSON BOYCOTT Next Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson is planning to renew their patent on Bedaquiline, a Tuberculosis (TB)  medication. This will keep the price of this medication high, since only J&J will be able to manufacture it, preventing millions of people in lower income countries from affording this medication. 

TB is entirely treatable, yet it kills more than 1,500,000 people a year due to the unaffordability of medication. Again it is ENTIRELY TREATABLE, but J&J’s patent currently prevents manufacturers around the world to distribute Bedaquiline to those in need. 

HOWEVER, this patent expired today, and if a large enough voice expresses dissent towards J&J’s plan to renew the patent, we can stop them from doing so. I’ve attached all the links you need to reach J&J in the comments. The company itself is not some evil force. Its made up of people who probably think they are doing the right thing. They arent. And we have to let them know that. 

As a consumer you have a certain power in the products you choose to buy. I encourage you to find other alternatives to J&J products, including Listerine, if they go through with this patent.

The proposed settlement would be paid out over 25 years through a subsidiary, which filed for bankruptcy to enable the $8.9 billion trust, Johnson & Johnson said in a court filing. If a bankruptcy court approves it, the agreement will resolve all current and future claims involving Johnson & Johnson products that contain talc, such as baby powder, the company said.

Johnson & Johnson,Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial,"Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial  

>Jurors urged to impose heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc trial - Lawyers representing the California man who claims to have suffered rare cancer as a result of exposure to asbestos contained in Johnson and Johnson's (JNJ.N) baby powder made of talc on Monday urged a juror to make the company pay hefty punitive damages the company's conduct as reckless as well as ""despicable.""

&#x200B;

[heavy punitive damages in Johnson & Johnson talc ](https://preview.redd.it/az635o7456db1.jpg?width=1173&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e045838470196163a8f6a6dc76b51c8881f355a5)

A prudent company would not market an item that allows carcinogens to be injected into infants,” Joseph Satterley, an attorney for Emory Hernandez Valadez, said in his closing argument after a six-week trial at Alameda County Superior Court in California.

J&J has always denied that the discontinued powder has asbestos or can cause cancer.

Satterley demanded that jurors give Hernandez punitive damages around nine times more than compensatory damages. These include $3.8 million for medical expenses and compensation for suffering and pain. Satterley claimed that the damages for pain and suffering should be far greater than the medical expenses.

The Supreme Court has decided that punitive damages should typically not exceed nine times compensatory damages and that a more excellent ratio may be reduced upon appeal as excessive.

J&J’s lawyers told jurors on Monday that there was no evidence linking Hernandez’s cancer with talc at trial. They also said that the company has always tried to test Talc’s properties and ensure its safety.

“What is most remarkable about the party with the burden of proof that they did not examine any bottles (he) says he used,” asbestos attorney Allison Brown said.

When the plaintiff’s doctor examined for evidence of asbestos in his body, they declared, “They found none – not a single asbestos fiber.”

The jury is expected to start deliberations on Tuesday.

Hernandez, who is 24, claimed in his suit that he was diagnosed with mesothelioma within the heart’s tissue due to exposure to J&J’s products for talc from the time as a child.

Thousands of plaintiffs have commenced lawsuits and alleged that J&J’s baby powder and other talc-based products may contain asbestos, which caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&J has claimed that its Talc powders are not harmful and don’t contain asbestos that has been linked to mesothelioma.

In April, J&J company subsidiary LTL Management [filed for bankruptcy](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/jjs-8-9-billion-talc-settlement-faces-us-bankruptcy-test/) in Trenton, New Jersey; it proposed that it pay $8.9 billion to resolve the more than 38,000 lawsuits and keep new ones from arising. It was the second attempt at settling the claims involving talc in bankruptcy following the U.S. appeals court ruling against an earlier offer.

The majority of litigation has been stopped in bankruptcy proceedings. However, U.S. Chief Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan, who is in charge of the LTL’s Chapter 11, let Hernandez’s trial go because he’s likely to survive only briefly.

Asbestos plaintiffs want to have LTL’s recent bankruptcy filing thrown out. They’ve argued that the filing was made in bad good faith to protect LTL from lawsuits.

J&J and LTL have claimed that bankruptcy provides settlement payments to plaintiffs fairer efficiently, effectively and relatively than trial courts. The latter have compared to a “lottery” where some litigants are awarded large amounts of money, while others get nothing.

J&J declared it was filing bankruptcy court papers that expenses of its talc-related court verdicts settlements, legal fees and settlements are estimated at [$4.5 billion](https://thejusticenow.com/legal-news/johnson-johnson-to-pay-8-9-billion-to-settle-talcum-powder-cancer-claims/).

As Johnson & Johnson is acutely aware, roughly 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis in 2021. The World Health Organization noted that ""Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries."" For regions like the Dominican Republic of the Congo, that statistic results in over 40,000 HIV-negative deaths annually--almost all of which could be prevented if it weren't for the financial burden upheld by the cost of Bedaquiline. Johnson & Johnson's profits have proliferated massively from the life-saving medication Bedaquiline--and that's a largely deserved consequence of assisting such a noble cause. That said, their profits have continued for two decades. These earnings have sustained for an exceedingly generous duration, and it's time to re-embrace J&J's cooperate credo: ""We believe our first responsibility is to the patients"" and that ""we must constantly strive to provide value, reduce our cost and maintain reasonable prices."" The latter half of this quote is where my largest concern lies. As J&J has noted, Bedaquiline costs between $340 to $400 for six months of treatment in low-income countries. Problematically, though, the average annual income in the DRC is $449. This price is unnecessarily exorbitant and directly contradicts this company's core values. Attempting to renew the 2007 Bedaquiline patent is utterly superfluous, and display's a direct responsibility to J&J's shareholders perpetually above the lives of millions who are each objectively equal in value to these investors.

As J&J is keenly conscious of, TB treatment costs will be lowered by as much as 67% if a generic version is allowed to enter the market. Given that J&J has undeniably fulfilled their financial incentives where, as stated in their credo, ""business partners must have an opportunity to make a fair profit,"" it is more than reasonable to expect the Bedaquiline patent to expire in the coming weeks. This final point is further bolstered when juxtaposed with the reality that an overwhelming majority of the research funding for Bedaquiline came from taxpayer money. Like most drugs in the last quarter century, Bedaquiline was financed by the people, patented by a corporation, and profited on by that entity for decades. J&J's services toward curing TB have been lavishly repaid in quantities exceeding their total investments by orders of magnitude; it's time to give back what always belonged to the people.

Without dismissing the realities mentioned above, it would be unreasonable to solely blame J&J for wanting to profit in a system that incentivizes revenue over ethics. However, it is entirely fair to scorn them ad nauseam for attempting to exploit this system to prolong their grossly inflated profits. While the healthcare sector J&J is a component of consistently emboldens revenue-centered practices, J&J's actions reflect a willingness to act as a martyr for maintaining this greed-driven catastrophe.

Without question, it's time for the Bedaquiline patent to expire. Any further attempts to delay this irrefutably equitable process directly and deplorably contradicts J&J's credo and will result in the boycotting of all J&J products until their decision is promptly reversed.

By securing a patent for Bedaquiline, J&J has generated revenue in the billions. The cost of a renewed patent, however, will total the lives of six million.

Pfizer,The 7 possible causes of Long Covid according to Pfizer,"The 7 possible causes of Long Covid according to Pfizer &#x200B;

1. **Viral Persistence**  
Studies have shown that, for some people, SARS-CoV-2 RNA may remain in the body well after the initial infection, resulting in the virus not being fully cleared and potentially causing chronic symptoms to persist.9  
 
2. **Immune Dysregulation**  
Studies looking at immune dysregulation, which occurs when the body can’t control an immune response,10 in individuals with long COVID have found T-cell alterations, including exhausted T cells and reduced CD4+ central memory cells.11 Studies have also reported ""highly activated innate immune cells,"" but a lack of naive T and B cells.12 These cells all play an important role in helping the immune system fight off current and future infections.12  
 
3. **Latent virus reactivation**  
A 2021 article in Frontiers in Microbiology notes, “It is well understood that humans accumulate persistent viruses over the course of a lifetime.”9 Though dormant, these viruses may reactivate when the immune system is weakened, challenged, or dysregulated. One or more strains of herpesvirus affect more than 90% of all people, though a strong immune system may keep the virus dormant. Studies have shown challenges to the immune system with long COVID may cause some viruses, like herpes may cause some viruses, like herpes, to flare up \[reactivate\].9  
 
4. **Autoimmunity**  
When the human immune system creates an antibody that targets the person's own tissues and organs, resulting in collateral damage or inflammation.13 SARS-CoV-2 may promote long COVID symptoms by activating our immune system in a manner that leads to long-term autoantibody production.14  
 
5. **Microclots**  
Microclots are tiny blood clots that can block blood vessels and alter the flow of oxygen and blood. When found in patients with acute COVID-19 and/or long COVID, microclots may lead to blockages in the circulatory system. Studying the effects of clotting in COVID can help researchers better understand if microclots contribute to long COVID and how treating them may improve chronic symptoms.15  
 
6. **Dysfunctional Neurological Signaling**  
Neurological complications may occur when the protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers in the brain, known as myelin,16 is damaged.9 This damage results in the dysfunction of brain cells and how the brain receives and sends information to the rest of the body.2 A 2022 study explored the relationship between even mild COVID infections and lasting cognitive impairment, noting the effect of long COVID on memory, concentration, and processing information.17  
 
7. **Disruption of the Microbiome**  
The human microbiome, which is comprised of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archea (microorganisms that are similar to bacteria but different in molecular organization) throughout the body,18 may be disrupted due to long COVID’s negative impact on the immune system. This disruption may result in inflammation and cause a breakdown of mucosal barriers, enabling bacteria to enter the body.9,18

Pfizer,"The US is the only country to fully approve the Pfizer Covid vaccine under its Comirnaty brand name. It's also the only country where you can't get Comirnaty, only the EUA version","The US is the only country to fully approve the Pfizer Covid vaccine under its Comirnaty brand name. It's also the only country where you can't get Comirnaty, only the EUA version In late 2021, the FDA fully approved the Covid Pfizer vaccine, under its official name, Comirnaty.

It quickly became evident that Comirnaty didn't exist in the field though, as injections continued under the experimental ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Officially this was because Pfizer had not yet converted to producing the new labels, although otherwise the two products were said to have no differences\*.

The weird thing is that a year later, all countries in the world had shifted to using Pfizer Covid vaccines officially labeled as Comirnaty, *except* in the US where they continued to exclusively the ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Although in court documents it was revealed that the US military did maintain some Comirnaty stocks on their bases, which is weird because they told their personnel to get vaccinated on their own, in the private sector. So while Comirnaty was *present* in the US, it was not however *available*.

Which is probably related to the reason they needed the FDA approval, because otherwise the Pentagon was not legally allowed to mandate US military personnel to take it. Forcing soldiers to take experimental drugs was explicitly banned following the Gulf War Syndrome disaster. By keeping Comirnaty on military bases, they probably wanted to create a legal loophole to claim it was ""available"" when it actually wasn't. The old ""we want to use up our old stocks first"" excuse, when those old stocks of EUA vaccines keep being resupplied.

&#x200B;

(\*Although if you read the press statements, you'll notice that Pfizer avoid saying they're identical, instead they just list a number of ways in which the two have no differences such as production process. This is lawyer speak for not admitting there is a difference but you don't want to admit it, it's how Bill Clinton was able to legally claim he ""did not have sex with that woman"" because oral sex was not included in the definition of sex when he was asked that question.)",-0.7338,-0.7338,-0.7338,-0.7338,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_commons/comments/1585mbe/the_us_is_the_only_country_to_fully_approve_the/,07/24/2023,14:30:06,Ok_Sea_6214,13,Americas

Of course, such a claim would likely get censored.  And censoring will, of course, help anyone claiming such a mandate is authoritarian understand they are misguided.

Pfizer,Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare),"Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare) Pfizer's own guidance, and its analysts expectations, guide for the company to make about $3.50 earnings this year and moving closer to $4 next year. 

This estimate takes into account the fact paxlovid and MRNA vaccine income is substantially reduced now. 

The long term industry average forward PER over 20 years for the healthcare sector in the USA is 15.5x. (That includes deeply indebted and troubled companies, in which regard Pfizer is better than the average). [1]

Assuming the company will likely return to around the long-term average of the sector in coming years. That would place Pfizer on a price of say 15.5x$3.50 = $54  to 15.5x$4 = $62, plus any further earnings growth. 

The price today is just $35. That suggests there  should be an opportunity to take a gain of 50-70% plus dividends plus growth, simply by waiting for mean reversion. 

It's also possible the pendulum of Pfizer or of the healthcare sector can swing to 18x-20x, as it has in the past, and there is some optionality value should a new strain of covid arise which requires urgent mass vaccination with a rapidly adjusted vaccine.

Similarly an argument can be made for BMY and a few others, though BMY has higher debt.

It's a pretty simple argument, but I think, quite compelling. Be sure to do your own research!

I hold PFE, I don't hold BMY.

Pfizer,Pfizer vaccine + alopecia,"Pfizer vaccine + alopecia I just saw an NHS doctor for the first time about my AA (I am pretty much bald now but seeing some progress) and one of the first questions he asked me was whether or not I had the Pfizer vaccine. 

He was careful to say that he wasn’t drawing a direct connection, but that they had seen many many patients who were given the Pfizer vaccines and have the same issue. 

It feels insane to admit amongst all the fear-mongering about the Covid vaccines, but with Pfizer’s recent FDA approval of Litfulo (similar to Olumiant) I can’t help but feel like a lot of us are caught up in some horrible medical scam. Litfulo costs over $2000/month for uninsured people / people whose insurance classifies alopecia as cosmetic.

Pfizer,The 7 possible causes of Long Covid according to Pfizer,"The 7 possible causes of Long Covid according to Pfizer &#x200B;

1. **Viral Persistence**  
Studies have shown that, for some people, SARS-CoV-2 RNA may remain in the body well after the initial infection, resulting in the virus not being fully cleared and potentially causing chronic symptoms to persist.9  
 
2. **Immune Dysregulation**  
Studies looking at immune dysregulation, which occurs when the body can’t control an immune response,10 in individuals with long COVID have found T-cell alterations, including exhausted T cells and reduced CD4+ central memory cells.11 Studies have also reported ""highly activated innate immune cells,"" but a lack of naive T and B cells.12 These cells all play an important role in helping the immune system fight off current and future infections.12  
 
3. **Latent virus reactivation**  
A 2021 article in Frontiers in Microbiology notes, “It is well understood that humans accumulate persistent viruses over the course of a lifetime.”9 Though dormant, these viruses may reactivate when the immune system is weakened, challenged, or dysregulated. One or more strains of herpesvirus affect more than 90% of all people, though a strong immune system may keep the virus dormant. Studies have shown challenges to the immune system with long COVID may cause some viruses, like herpes may cause some viruses, like herpes, to flare up \[reactivate\].9  
 
4. **Autoimmunity**  
When the human immune system creates an antibody that targets the person's own tissues and organs, resulting in collateral damage or inflammation.13 SARS-CoV-2 may promote long COVID symptoms by activating our immune system in a manner that leads to long-term autoantibody production.14  
 
5. **Microclots**  
Microclots are tiny blood clots that can block blood vessels and alter the flow of oxygen and blood. When found in patients with acute COVID-19 and/or long COVID, microclots may lead to blockages in the circulatory system. Studying the effects of clotting in COVID can help researchers better understand if microclots contribute to long COVID and how treating them may improve chronic symptoms.15  
 
6. **Dysfunctional Neurological Signaling**  
Neurological complications may occur when the protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers in the brain, known as myelin,16 is damaged.9 This damage results in the dysfunction of brain cells and how the brain receives and sends information to the rest of the body.2 A 2022 study explored the relationship between even mild COVID infections and lasting cognitive impairment, noting the effect of long COVID on memory, concentration, and processing information.17  
 
7. **Disruption of the Microbiome**  
The human microbiome, which is comprised of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archea (microorganisms that are similar to bacteria but different in molecular organization) throughout the body,18 may be disrupted due to long COVID’s negative impact on the immune system. This disruption may result in inflammation and cause a breakdown of mucosal barriers, enabling bacteria to enter the body.9,18

Pfizer,"The US is the only country to fully approve the Pfizer Covid vaccine under its Comirnaty brand name. It's also the only country where you can't get Comirnaty, only the EUA version","The US is the only country to fully approve the Pfizer Covid vaccine under its Comirnaty brand name. It's also the only country where you can't get Comirnaty, only the EUA version In late 2021, the FDA fully approved the Covid Pfizer vaccine, under its official name, Comirnaty.

It quickly became evident that Comirnaty didn't exist in the field though, as injections continued under the experimental ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Officially this was because Pfizer had not yet converted to producing the new labels, although otherwise the two products were said to have no differences\*.

The weird thing is that a year later, all countries in the world had shifted to using Pfizer Covid vaccines officially labeled as Comirnaty, *except* in the US where they continued to exclusively the ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Although in court documents it was revealed that the US military did maintain some Comirnaty stocks on their bases, which is weird because they told their personnel to get vaccinated on their own, in the private sector. So while Comirnaty was *present* in the US, it was not however *available*.

Which is probably related to the reason they needed the FDA approval, because otherwise the Pentagon was not legally allowed to mandate US military personnel to take it. Forcing soldiers to take experimental drugs was explicitly banned following the Gulf War Syndrome disaster. By keeping Comirnaty on military bases, they probably wanted to create a legal loophole to claim it was ""available"" when it actually wasn't. The old ""we want to use up our old stocks first"" excuse, when those old stocks of EUA vaccines keep being resupplied.

&#x200B;

(\*Although if you read the press statements, you'll notice that Pfizer avoid saying they're identical, instead they just list a number of ways in which the two have no differences such as production process. This is lawyer speak for not admitting there is a difference but you don't want to admit it, it's how Bill Clinton was able to legally claim he ""did not have sex with that woman"" because oral sex was not included in the definition of sex when he was asked that question.)",-0.7338,-0.7338,-0.7338,-0.7338,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_commons/comments/1585mbe/the_us_is_the_only_country_to_fully_approve_the/,07/24/2023,14:30:06,Ok_Sea_6214,13,Europe

Pfizer,Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare),"Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare) Pfizer's own guidance, and its analysts expectations, guide for the company to make about $3.50 earnings this year and moving closer to $4 next year. 

This estimate takes into account the fact paxlovid and MRNA vaccine income is substantially reduced now. 

The long term industry average forward PER over 20 years for the healthcare sector in the USA is 15.5x. (That includes deeply indebted and troubled companies, in which regard Pfizer is better than the average). [1]

Assuming the company will likely return to around the long-term average of the sector in coming years. That would place Pfizer on a price of say 15.5x$3.50 = $54  to 15.5x$4 = $62, plus any further earnings growth. 

The price today is just $35. That suggests there  should be an opportunity to take a gain of 50-70% plus dividends plus growth, simply by waiting for mean reversion. 

It's also possible the pendulum of Pfizer or of the healthcare sector can swing to 18x-20x, as it has in the past, and there is some optionality value should a new strain of covid arise which requires urgent mass vaccination with a rapidly adjusted vaccine.

Similarly an argument can be made for BMY and a few others, though BMY has higher debt.

It's a pretty simple argument, but I think, quite compelling. Be sure to do your own research!

I hold PFE, I don't hold BMY.

Pfizer,The 7 possible causes of Long Covid according to Pfizer,"The 7 possible causes of Long Covid according to Pfizer &#x200B;

1. **Viral Persistence**  
Studies have shown that, for some people, SARS-CoV-2 RNA may remain in the body well after the initial infection, resulting in the virus not being fully cleared and potentially causing chronic symptoms to persist.9  
 
2. **Immune Dysregulation**  
Studies looking at immune dysregulation, which occurs when the body can’t control an immune response,10 in individuals with long COVID have found T-cell alterations, including exhausted T cells and reduced CD4+ central memory cells.11 Studies have also reported ""highly activated innate immune cells,"" but a lack of naive T and B cells.12 These cells all play an important role in helping the immune system fight off current and future infections.12  
 
3. **Latent virus reactivation**  
A 2021 article in Frontiers in Microbiology notes, “It is well understood that humans accumulate persistent viruses over the course of a lifetime.”9 Though dormant, these viruses may reactivate when the immune system is weakened, challenged, or dysregulated. One or more strains of herpesvirus affect more than 90% of all people, though a strong immune system may keep the virus dormant. Studies have shown challenges to the immune system with long COVID may cause some viruses, like herpes may cause some viruses, like herpes, to flare up \[reactivate\].9  
 
4. **Autoimmunity**  
When the human immune system creates an antibody that targets the person's own tissues and organs, resulting in collateral damage or inflammation.13 SARS-CoV-2 may promote long COVID symptoms by activating our immune system in a manner that leads to long-term autoantibody production.14  
 
5. **Microclots**  
Microclots are tiny blood clots that can block blood vessels and alter the flow of oxygen and blood. When found in patients with acute COVID-19 and/or long COVID, microclots may lead to blockages in the circulatory system. Studying the effects of clotting in COVID can help researchers better understand if microclots contribute to long COVID and how treating them may improve chronic symptoms.15  
 
6. **Dysfunctional Neurological Signaling**  
Neurological complications may occur when the protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers in the brain, known as myelin,16 is damaged.9 This damage results in the dysfunction of brain cells and how the brain receives and sends information to the rest of the body.2 A 2022 study explored the relationship between even mild COVID infections and lasting cognitive impairment, noting the effect of long COVID on memory, concentration, and processing information.17  
 
7. **Disruption of the Microbiome**  
The human microbiome, which is comprised of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archea (microorganisms that are similar to bacteria but different in molecular organization) throughout the body,18 may be disrupted due to long COVID’s negative impact on the immune system. This disruption may result in inflammation and cause a breakdown of mucosal barriers, enabling bacteria to enter the body.9,18

Pfizer,Just a reminder Pfizer admitted to the EU the vaccine was never even tested to stop the spread.,"Just a reminder Pfizer admitted to the EU the vaccine was never even tested to stop the spread. >**Pfizer admitted to the European Parliament that it had not tested the ability of its COVID-19 vaccine to prevent transmission**.   Pfizer never claimed that its clinical trial, upon which the vaccine was authorized for use, evaluated the shot’s effect on transmission. In fact, shortly before the vaccine’s release, the company’s CEO emphasized that this was still being evaluated.
 
Ouch.  Narrative over.

Pfizer,"The US is the only country to fully approve the Pfizer Covid vaccine under its Comirnaty brand name. It's also the only country where you can't get Comirnaty, only the EUA version","The US is the only country to fully approve the Pfizer Covid vaccine under its Comirnaty brand name. It's also the only country where you can't get Comirnaty, only the EUA version In late 2021, the FDA fully approved the Covid Pfizer vaccine, under its official name, Comirnaty.

It quickly became evident that Comirnaty didn't exist in the field though, as injections continued under the experimental ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Officially this was because Pfizer had not yet converted to producing the new labels, although otherwise the two products were said to have no differences\*.

The weird thing is that a year later, all countries in the world had shifted to using Pfizer Covid vaccines officially labeled as Comirnaty, *except* in the US where they continued to exclusively the ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Although in court documents it was revealed that the US military did maintain some Comirnaty stocks on their bases, which is weird because they told their personnel to get vaccinated on their own, in the private sector. So while Comirnaty was *present* in the US, it was not however *available*.

Which is probably related to the reason they needed the FDA approval, because otherwise the Pentagon was not legally allowed to mandate US military personnel to take it. Forcing soldiers to take experimental drugs was explicitly banned following the Gulf War Syndrome disaster. By keeping Comirnaty on military bases, they probably wanted to create a legal loophole to claim it was ""available"" when it actually wasn't. The old ""we want to use up our old stocks first"" excuse, when those old stocks of EUA vaccines keep being resupplied.

&#x200B;

(\*Although if you read the press statements, you'll notice that Pfizer avoid saying they're identical, instead they just list a number of ways in which the two have no differences such as production process. This is lawyer speak for not admitting there is a difference but you don't want to admit it, it's how Bill Clinton was able to legally claim he ""did not have sex with that woman"" because oral sex was not included in the definition of sex when he was asked that question.)",-0.7338,-0.7338,-0.7338,-0.7338,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_commons/comments/1585mbe/the_us_is_the_only_country_to_fully_approve_the/,07/24/2023,14:30:06,Ok_Sea_6214,13,Africa

So, you can’t say no, you can’t sue for harm, and you can’t see the data underlying the government’s claim that the product is safe and effective.  Some might describe such conduct as authoritarian.  Of course, such a claim would likely get censored.  And censoring will, of course, help anyone claiming such a mandate is authoritarian understand they are misguided.

Pfizer,Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare),"Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare) Pfizer's own guidance, and its analysts expectations, guide for the company to make about $3.50 earnings this year and moving closer to $4 next year. 

This estimate takes into account the fact paxlovid and MRNA vaccine income is substantially reduced now. 

The long term industry average forward PER over 20 years for the healthcare sector in the USA is 15.5x. (That includes deeply indebted and troubled companies, in which regard Pfizer is better than the average). [1]

Assuming the company will likely return to around the long-term average of the sector in coming years. That would place Pfizer on a price of say 15.5x$3.50 = $54  to 15.5x$4 = $62, plus any further earnings growth. 

The price today is just $35. That suggests there  should be an opportunity to take a gain of 50-70% plus dividends plus growth, simply by waiting for mean reversion. 

It's also possible the pendulum of Pfizer or of the healthcare sector can swing to 18x-20x, as it has in the past, and there is some optionality value should a new strain of covid arise which requires urgent mass vaccination with a rapidly adjusted vaccine.

Similarly an argument can be made for BMY and a few others, though BMY has higher debt.

It's a pretty simple argument, but I think, quite compelling. Be sure to do your own research!

I hold PFE, I don't hold BMY.

Pfizer,Pfizer vaccine + alopecia,"Pfizer vaccine + alopecia I just saw an NHS doctor for the first time about my AA (I am pretty much bald now but seeing some progress) and one of the first questions he asked me was whether or not I had the Pfizer vaccine. 

He was careful to say that he wasn’t drawing a direct connection, but that they had seen many many patients who were given the Pfizer vaccines and have the same issue. 

It feels insane to admit amongst all the fear-mongering about the Covid vaccines, but with Pfizer’s recent FDA approval of Litfulo (similar to Olumiant) I can’t help but feel like a lot of us are caught up in some horrible medical scam. Litfulo costs over $2000/month for uninsured people / people whose insurance classifies alopecia as cosmetic.

Pfizer,The 7 possible causes of Long Covid according to Pfizer,"The 7 possible causes of Long Covid according to Pfizer &#x200B;

1. **Viral Persistence**  
Studies have shown that, for some people, SARS-CoV-2 RNA may remain in the body well after the initial infection, resulting in the virus not being fully cleared and potentially causing chronic symptoms to persist.9  
 
2. **Immune Dysregulation**  
Studies looking at immune dysregulation, which occurs when the body can’t control an immune response,10 in individuals with long COVID have found T-cell alterations, including exhausted T cells and reduced CD4+ central memory cells.11 Studies have also reported ""highly activated innate immune cells,"" but a lack of naive T and B cells.12 These cells all play an important role in helping the immune system fight off current and future infections.12  
 
3. **Latent virus reactivation**  
A 2021 article in Frontiers in Microbiology notes, “It is well understood that humans accumulate persistent viruses over the course of a lifetime.”9 Though dormant, these viruses may reactivate when the immune system is weakened, challenged, or dysregulated. One or more strains of herpesvirus affect more than 90% of all people, though a strong immune system may keep the virus dormant. Studies have shown challenges to the immune system with long COVID may cause some viruses, like herpes may cause some viruses, like herpes, to flare up \[reactivate\].9  
 
4. **Autoimmunity**  
When the human immune system creates an antibody that targets the person's own tissues and organs, resulting in collateral damage or inflammation.13 SARS-CoV-2 may promote long COVID symptoms by activating our immune system in a manner that leads to long-term autoantibody production.14  
 
5. **Microclots**  
Microclots are tiny blood clots that can block blood vessels and alter the flow of oxygen and blood. When found in patients with acute COVID-19 and/or long COVID, microclots may lead to blockages in the circulatory system. Studying the effects of clotting in COVID can help researchers better understand if microclots contribute to long COVID and how treating them may improve chronic symptoms.15  
 
6. **Dysfunctional Neurological Signaling**  
Neurological complications may occur when the protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers in the brain, known as myelin,16 is damaged.9 This damage results in the dysfunction of brain cells and how the brain receives and sends information to the rest of the body.2 A 2022 study explored the relationship between even mild COVID infections and lasting cognitive impairment, noting the effect of long COVID on memory, concentration, and processing information.17  
 
7. **Disruption of the Microbiome**  
The human microbiome, which is comprised of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archea (microorganisms that are similar to bacteria but different in molecular organization) throughout the body,18 may be disrupted due to long COVID’s negative impact on the immune system. This disruption may result in inflammation and cause a breakdown of mucosal barriers, enabling bacteria to enter the body.9,18

Pfizer,"The US is the only country to fully approve the Pfizer Covid vaccine under its Comirnaty brand name. It's also the only country where you can't get Comirnaty, only the EUA version","The US is the only country to fully approve the Pfizer Covid vaccine under its Comirnaty brand name. It's also the only country where you can't get Comirnaty, only the EUA version In late 2021, the FDA fully approved the Covid Pfizer vaccine, under its official name, Comirnaty.

It quickly became evident that Comirnaty didn't exist in the field though, as injections continued under the experimental ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Officially this was because Pfizer had not yet converted to producing the new labels, although otherwise the two products were said to have no differences\*.

The weird thing is that a year later, all countries in the world had shifted to using Pfizer Covid vaccines officially labeled as Comirnaty, *except* in the US where they continued to exclusively the ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Although in court documents it was revealed that the US military did maintain some Comirnaty stocks on their bases, which is weird because they told their personnel to get vaccinated on their own, in the private sector. So while Comirnaty was *present* in the US, it was not however *available*.

Which is probably related to the reason they needed the FDA approval, because otherwise the Pentagon was not legally allowed to mandate US military personnel to take it. Forcing soldiers to take experimental drugs was explicitly banned following the Gulf War Syndrome disaster. By keeping Comirnaty on military bases, they probably wanted to create a legal loophole to claim it was ""available"" when it actually wasn't. The old ""we want to use up our old stocks first"" excuse, when those old stocks of EUA vaccines keep being resupplied.

&#x200B;

(\*Although if you read the press statements, you'll notice that Pfizer avoid saying they're identical, instead they just list a number of ways in which the two have no differences such as production process. This is lawyer speak for not admitting there is a difference but you don't want to admit it, it's how Bill Clinton was able to legally claim he ""did not have sex with that woman"" because oral sex was not included in the definition of sex when he was asked that question.)",-0.7338,-0.7338,-0.7338,-0.7338,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_commons/comments/1585mbe/the_us_is_the_only_country_to_fully_approve_the/,07/24/2023,14:30:06,Ok_Sea_6214,13,Asia

Of course, such a claim would likely get censored.  And censoring will, of course, help anyone claiming such a mandate is authoritarian understand they are misguided.

Pfizer,Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare),"Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare) Pfizer's own guidance, and its analysts expectations, guide for the company to make about $3.50 earnings this year and moving closer to $4 next year. 

This estimate takes into account the fact paxlovid and MRNA vaccine income is substantially reduced now. 

The long term industry average forward PER over 20 years for the healthcare sector in the USA is 15.5x. (That includes deeply indebted and troubled companies, in which regard Pfizer is better than the average). [1]

Assuming the company will likely return to around the long-term average of the sector in coming years. That would place Pfizer on a price of say 15.5x$3.50 = $54  to 15.5x$4 = $62, plus any further earnings growth. 

The price today is just $35. That suggests there  should be an opportunity to take a gain of 50-70% plus dividends plus growth, simply by waiting for mean reversion. 

It's also possible the pendulum of Pfizer or of the healthcare sector can swing to 18x-20x, as it has in the past, and there is some optionality value should a new strain of covid arise which requires urgent mass vaccination with a rapidly adjusted vaccine.

Similarly an argument can be made for BMY and a few others, though BMY has higher debt.

It's a pretty simple argument, but I think, quite compelling. Be sure to do your own research!

I hold PFE, I don't hold BMY.

It feels insane to admit amongst all the fear-mongering about the Covid vaccines, but with Pfizer’s recent FDA approval of Litfulo (similar to Olumiant) I can’t help but feel like a lot of us are caught up in some horrible medical scam.

Pfizer,The 7 possible causes of Long Covid according to Pfizer,"The 7 possible causes of Long Covid according to Pfizer &#x200B;

1. **Viral Persistence**  
Studies have shown that, for some people, SARS-CoV-2 RNA may remain in the body well after the initial infection, resulting in the virus not being fully cleared and potentially causing chronic symptoms to persist.9  
 
2. **Immune Dysregulation**  
Studies looking at immune dysregulation, which occurs when the body can’t control an immune response,10 in individuals with long COVID have found T-cell alterations, including exhausted T cells and reduced CD4+ central memory cells.11 Studies have also reported ""highly activated innate immune cells,"" but a lack of naive T and B cells.12 These cells all play an important role in helping the immune system fight off current and future infections.12  
 
3. **Latent virus reactivation**  
A 2021 article in Frontiers in Microbiology notes, “It is well understood that humans accumulate persistent viruses over the course of a lifetime.”9 Though dormant, these viruses may reactivate when the immune system is weakened, challenged, or dysregulated. One or more strains of herpesvirus affect more than 90% of all people, though a strong immune system may keep the virus dormant. Studies have shown challenges to the immune system with long COVID may cause some viruses, like herpes may cause some viruses, like herpes, to flare up \[reactivate\].9  
 
4. **Autoimmunity**  
When the human immune system creates an antibody that targets the person's own tissues and organs, resulting in collateral damage or inflammation.13 SARS-CoV-2 may promote long COVID symptoms by activating our immune system in a manner that leads to long-term autoantibody production.14  
 
5. **Microclots**  
Microclots are tiny blood clots that can block blood vessels and alter the flow of oxygen and blood. When found in patients with acute COVID-19 and/or long COVID, microclots may lead to blockages in the circulatory system. Studying the effects of clotting in COVID can help researchers better understand if microclots contribute to long COVID and how treating them may improve chronic symptoms.15  
 
6. **Dysfunctional Neurological Signaling**  
Neurological complications may occur when the protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers in the brain, known as myelin,16 is damaged.9 This damage results in the dysfunction of brain cells and how the brain receives and sends information to the rest of the body.2 A 2022 study explored the relationship between even mild COVID infections and lasting cognitive impairment, noting the effect of long COVID on memory, concentration, and processing information.17  
 
7. **Disruption of the Microbiome**  
The human microbiome, which is comprised of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archea (microorganisms that are similar to bacteria but different in molecular organization) throughout the body,18 may be disrupted due to long COVID’s negative impact on the immune system. This disruption may result in inflammation and cause a breakdown of mucosal barriers, enabling bacteria to enter the body.9,18

Pfizer,"The US is the only country to fully approve the Pfizer Covid vaccine under its Comirnaty brand name. It's also the only country where you can't get Comirnaty, only the EUA version","The US is the only country to fully approve the Pfizer Covid vaccine under its Comirnaty brand name. It's also the only country where you can't get Comirnaty, only the EUA version In late 2021, the FDA fully approved the Covid Pfizer vaccine, under its official name, Comirnaty.

It quickly became evident that Comirnaty didn't exist in the field though, as injections continued under the experimental ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Officially this was because Pfizer had not yet converted to producing the new labels, although otherwise the two products were said to have no differences\*.

The weird thing is that a year later, all countries in the world had shifted to using Pfizer Covid vaccines officially labeled as Comirnaty, *except* in the US where they continued to exclusively the ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Although in court documents it was revealed that the US military did maintain some Comirnaty stocks on their bases, which is weird because they told their personnel to get vaccinated on their own, in the private sector. So while Comirnaty was *present* in the US, it was not however *available*.

Which is probably related to the reason they needed the FDA approval, because otherwise the Pentagon was not legally allowed to mandate US military personnel to take it. Forcing soldiers to take experimental drugs was explicitly banned following the Gulf War Syndrome disaster. By keeping Comirnaty on military bases, they probably wanted to create a legal loophole to claim it was ""available"" when it actually wasn't. The old ""we want to use up our old stocks first"" excuse, when those old stocks of EUA vaccines keep being resupplied.

&#x200B;

(\*Although if you read the press statements, you'll notice that Pfizer avoid saying they're identical, instead they just list a number of ways in which the two have no differences such as production process.

Pfizer,Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare),"Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare) Pfizer's own guidance, and its analysts expectations, guide for the company to make about $3.50 earnings this year and moving closer to $4 next year. 

This estimate takes into account the fact paxlovid and MRNA vaccine income is substantially reduced now. 

The long term industry average forward PER over 20 years for the healthcare sector in the USA is 15.5x. (That includes deeply indebted and troubled companies, in which regard Pfizer is better than the average). [1]

Assuming the company will likely return to around the long-term average of the sector in coming years. That would place Pfizer on a price of say 15.5x$3.50 = $54  to 15.5x$4 = $62, plus any further earnings growth. 

The price today is just $35. That suggests there  should be an opportunity to take a gain of 50-70% plus dividends plus growth, simply by waiting for mean reversion. 

It's also possible the pendulum of Pfizer or of the healthcare sector can swing to 18x-20x, as it has in the past, and there is some optionality value should a new strain of covid arise which requires urgent mass vaccination with a rapidly adjusted vaccine.

Similarly an argument can be made for BMY and a few others, though BMY has higher debt.

It's a pretty simple argument, but I think, quite compelling. Be sure to do your own research!

Pfizer,Pfizer vaccine + alopecia,"Pfizer vaccine + alopecia I just saw an NHS doctor for the first time about my AA (I am pretty much bald now but seeing some progress) and one of the first questions he asked me was whether or not I had the Pfizer vaccine. 

He was careful to say that he wasn’t drawing a direct connection, but that they had seen many many patients who were given the Pfizer vaccines and have the same issue. 

It feels insane to admit amongst all the fear-mongering about the Covid vaccines, but with Pfizer’s recent FDA approval of Litfulo (similar to Olumiant) I can’t help but feel like a lot of us are caught up in some horrible medical scam. Litfulo costs over $2000/month for uninsured people / people whose insurance classifies alopecia as cosmetic. 

This is a rant post that I will probably remove, but I feel so angry and frustrated that there is no platform to talk about this.",-0.9513,-0.9513,-0.9513,-0.9513,https://www.reddit.com/r/alopecia_areata/comments/14vatyr/pfizer_vaccine_alopecia/,07/10/2023,02:46:04,_sainthelen,32,Other

Studies looking at immune dysregulation, which occurs when the body can’t control an immune response,10 in individuals with long COVID have found T-cell alterations, including exhausted T cells and reduced CD4+ central memory cells.11 Studies have also reported ""highly activated innate immune cells,"" but a lack of naive T and B cells.12 These cells all play an important role in helping the immune system fight off current and future infections.12  
 
3. **Latent virus reactivation**  
A 2021 article in Frontiers in Microbiology notes, “It is well understood that humans accumulate persistent viruses over the course of a lifetime.”9 Though dormant, these viruses may reactivate when the immune system is weakened, challenged, or dysregulated. One or more strains of herpesvirus affect more than 90% of all people, though a strong immune system may keep the virus dormant. Studies have shown challenges to the immune system with long COVID may cause some viruses, like herpes may cause some viruses, like herpes, to flare up \[reactivate\].9  
 
4. **Autoimmunity**  
When the human immune system creates an antibody that targets the person's own tissues and organs, resulting in collateral damage or inflammation.13 SARS-CoV-2 may promote long COVID symptoms by activating our immune system in a manner that leads to long-term autoantibody production.14  
 
5. **Microclots**  
Microclots are tiny blood clots that can block blood vessels and alter the flow of oxygen and blood. When found in patients with acute COVID-19 and/or long COVID, microclots may lead to blockages in the circulatory system. Studying the effects of clotting in COVID can help researchers better understand if microclots contribute to long COVID and how treating them may improve chronic symptoms.15  
 
6. **Dysfunctional Neurological Signaling**  
Neurological complications may occur when the protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers in the brain, known as myelin,16 is damaged.9 This damage results in the dysfunction of brain cells and how the brain receives and sends information to the rest of the body.2 A 2022 study explored the relationship between even mild COVID infections and lasting cognitive impairment, noting the effect of long COVID on memory, concentration, and processing information.17  
 
7. **Disruption of the Microbiome**  
The human microbiome, which is comprised of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archea (microorganisms that are similar to bacteria but different in molecular organization) throughout the body,18 may be disrupted due to long COVID’s negative impact on the immune system. This disruption may result in inflammation and cause a breakdown of mucosal barriers, enabling bacteria to enter the body.9,18

Pfizer never claimed that its clinical trial, upon which the vaccine was authorized for use, evaluated the shot’s effect on transmission. In fact, shortly before the vaccine’s release, the company’s CEO emphasized that this was still being evaluated.

It's also the only country where you can't get Comirnaty, only the EUA version In late 2021, the FDA fully approved the Covid Pfizer vaccine, under its official name, Comirnaty.

It quickly became evident that Comirnaty didn't exist in the field though, as injections continued under the experimental ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Officially this was because Pfizer had not yet converted to producing the new labels, although otherwise the two products were said to have no differences\*.

The weird thing is that a year later, all countries in the world had shifted to using Pfizer Covid vaccines officially labeled as Comirnaty, *except* in the US where they continued to exclusively the ""EUA Pfizer Covid vaccine"" version. Although in court documents it was revealed that the US military did maintain some Comirnaty stocks on their bases, which is weird because they told their personnel to get vaccinated on their own, in the private sector. So while Comirnaty was *present* in the US, it was not however *available*.

Which is probably related to the reason they needed the FDA approval, because otherwise the Pentagon was not legally allowed to mandate US military personnel to take it. Forcing soldiers to take experimental drugs was explicitly banned following the Gulf War Syndrome disaster. By keeping Comirnaty on military bases, they probably wanted to create a legal loophole to claim it was ""available"" when it actually wasn't. The old ""we want to use up our old stocks first"" excuse, when those old stocks of EUA vaccines keep being resupplied.

&#x200B;

(\*Although if you read the press statements, you'll notice that Pfizer avoid saying they're identical, instead they just list a number of ways in which the two have no differences such as production process. This is lawyer speak for not admitting there is a difference but you don't want to admit it, it's how Bill Clinton was able to legally claim he ""did not have sex with that woman"" because oral sex was not included in the definition of sex when he was asked that question.)",-0.7338,-0.7338,-0.7338,-0.7338,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_commons/comments/1585mbe/the_us_is_the_only_country_to_fully_approve_the/,07/24/2023,14:30:06,Ok_Sea_6214,13,

Of course, such a claim would likely get censored.  And censoring will, of course, help anyone claiming such a mandate is authoritarian understand they are misguided.

Pfizer,Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare),"Making a case for Pfizer (and other healthcare) Pfizer's own guidance, and its analysts expectations, guide for the company to make about $3.50 earnings this year and moving closer to $4 next year. 

This estimate takes into account the fact paxlovid and MRNA vaccine income is substantially reduced now. 

The long term industry average forward PER over 20 years for the healthcare sector in the USA is 15.5x. (That includes deeply indebted and troubled companies, in which regard Pfizer is better than the average). [1]

Assuming the company will likely return to around the long-term average of the sector in coming years. That would place Pfizer on a price of say 15.5x$3.50 = $54  to 15.5x$4 = $62, plus any further earnings growth. 

The price today is just $35. That suggests there  should be an opportunity to take a gain of 50-70% plus dividends plus growth, simply by waiting for mean reversion. 

It's also possible the pendulum of Pfizer or of the healthcare sector can swing to 18x-20x, as it has in the past, and there is some optionality value should a new strain of covid arise which requires urgent mass vaccination with a rapidly adjusted vaccine.

Similarly an argument can be made for BMY and a few others, though BMY has higher debt.

It's a pretty simple argument, but I think, quite compelling. Be sure to do your own research!

I hold PFE, I don't hold BMY.

Pfizer,Pfizer vaccine + alopecia,"Pfizer vaccine + alopecia I just saw an NHS doctor for the first time about my AA (I am pretty much bald now but seeing some progress) and one of the first questions he asked me was whether or not I had the Pfizer vaccine. 

He was careful to say that he wasn’t drawing a direct connection, but that they had seen many many patients who were given the Pfizer vaccines and have the same issue. 

It feels insane to admit amongst all the fear-mongering about the Covid vaccines, but with Pfizer’s recent FDA approval of Litfulo (similar to Olumiant) I can’t help but feel like a lot of us are caught up in some horrible medical scam. Litfulo costs over $2000/month for uninsured people / people whose insurance classifies alopecia as cosmetic.

Merck & Co,Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine,"Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine TL:DR
They’re the ones producing J&J’s Covid vaccine. More vaccines needed, more money for MRK. 


Who is Merck & Co (MRK)?

MRK is a research intensive biopharmaceutical company that brings forward medicine and vaccines. They research for medicines and vaccines for viruses like cancer, HIV, etc that affect animals and humans. But lately, they’ve been working on COVID-19.
https://www.merck.com/company-overview/ 


Why MRK will go up 

With the recent announcement from Biden that we’ll have enough vaccines for all American adults by May, J&J needs someone to manufacture their single shot vaccine. This is where MRK comes in. As the number of vaccines produce increase and the number of people getting vaccinated increase it’ll only increase the stock price of MRK.

Merck & Co,Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine,"Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine TL:DR
They’re the ones producing J&J’s Covid vaccine. More vaccines needed, more money for MRK. 


Who is Merck & Co (MRK)?

MRK is a research intensive biopharmaceutical company that brings forward medicine and vaccines. They research for medicines and vaccines for viruses like cancer, HIV, etc that affect animals and humans. But lately, they’ve been working on COVID-19.
https://www.merck.com/company-overview/ 


Why MRK will go up 

With the recent announcement from Biden that we’ll have enough vaccines for all American adults by May, J&J needs someone to manufacture their single shot vaccine. This is where MRK comes in. As the number of vaccines produce increase and the number of people getting vaccinated increase it’ll only increase the stock price of MRK.

Merck & Co,Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine,"Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine TL:DR
They’re the ones producing J&J’s Covid vaccine. More vaccines needed, more money for MRK. 


Who is Merck & Co (MRK)?

MRK is a research intensive biopharmaceutical company that brings forward medicine and vaccines. They research for medicines and vaccines for viruses like cancer, HIV, etc that affect animals and humans. But lately, they’ve been working on COVID-19.
https://www.merck.com/company-overview/ 


Why MRK will go up 

With the recent announcement from Biden that we’ll have enough vaccines for all American adults by May, J&J needs someone to manufacture their single shot vaccine. This is where MRK comes in. As the number of vaccines produce increase and the number of people getting vaccinated increase it’ll only increase the stock price of MRK.

Merck & Co,Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine,"Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine TL:DR
They’re the ones producing J&J’s Covid vaccine. More vaccines needed, more money for MRK. 


Who is Merck & Co (MRK)?

MRK is a research intensive biopharmaceutical company that brings forward medicine and vaccines. They research for medicines and vaccines for viruses like cancer, HIV, etc that affect animals and humans. But lately, they’ve been working on COVID-19.
https://www.merck.com/company-overview/ 


Why MRK will go up 

With the recent announcement from Biden that we’ll have enough vaccines for all American adults by May, J&J needs someone to manufacture their single shot vaccine. This is where MRK comes in. As the number of vaccines produce increase and the number of people getting vaccinated increase it’ll only increase the stock price of MRK.

Merck & Co,Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine,"Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine TL:DR
They’re the ones producing J&J’s Covid vaccine. More vaccines needed, more money for MRK. 


Who is Merck & Co (MRK)?

MRK is a research intensive biopharmaceutical company that brings forward medicine and vaccines. They research for medicines and vaccines for viruses like cancer, HIV, etc that affect animals and humans. But lately, they’ve been working on COVID-19.
https://www.merck.com/company-overview/ 


Why MRK will go up 

With the recent announcement from Biden that we’ll have enough vaccines for all American adults by May, J&J needs someone to manufacture their single shot vaccine. This is where MRK comes in. As the number of vaccines produce increase and the number of people getting vaccinated increase it’ll only increase the stock price of MRK.

Merck & Co,Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine,"Merck & Co (MRK) partnering with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) to produce single shot Covid vaccine TL:DR
They’re the ones producing J&J’s Covid vaccine. More vaccines needed, more money for MRK. 


Who is Merck & Co (MRK)?

MRK is a research intensive biopharmaceutical company that brings forward medicine and vaccines. They research for medicines and vaccines for viruses like cancer, HIV, etc that affect animals and humans. But lately, they’ve been working on COVID-19.
https://www.merck.com/company-overview/ 


Why MRK will go up 

With the recent announcement from Biden that we’ll have enough vaccines for all American adults by May, J&J needs someone to manufacture their single shot vaccine. This is where MRK comes in. As the number of vaccines produce increase and the number of people getting vaccinated increase it’ll only increase the stock price of MRK.
